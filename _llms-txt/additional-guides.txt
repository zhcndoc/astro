# Authentication

> An intro to authentication in Astro

Authentication and authorization are two security processes that manage access to your website or app. Authentication verifies a visitor’s identity, while authorization grants access to protected areas and resources. Authentication allows you to customize areas of your site for logged-in individuals and provides the greatest protection for personal or private information. Authentication libraries (e.g. [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), [Clerk](https://clerk.com)) provide utilities for multiple authentication methods such as email sign-in and OAuth providers. See how to [add authentication with Supabase](/en/guides/backend/supabase/#adding-authentication-with-supabase) or [add authentication with Firebase](/en/guides/backend/google-firebase/#adding-authentication-with-firebase) in our dedicated guides for these backend services. ## Auth.js [Section titled “Auth.js”](#authjs) Auth.js is a framework agnostic solution for authentication. A community framework adapter [`auth-astro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auth-astro) is available for Astro. ### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation) Use the `astro add` command for your preferred package manager to add the `auth-astro` integration. * npm ```shell npx astro add auth-astro ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm astro add auth-astro ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn astro add auth-astro ``` #### Manual installation [Section titled “Manual installation”](#manual-installation) To install `auth-astro` manually, install the required package for your package manager: * npm ```shell npm install auth-astro @auth/core@^0.18.6 ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add auth-astro @auth/core@^0.18.6 ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add auth-astro @auth/core@^0.18.6 ``` Then, apply the integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; +import auth from 'auth-astro'; export default defineConfig({ // ... + integrations: [auth()], }); ``` ### Configuration [Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration) Create an `auth.config.ts` file in your project’s root directory. Add any auth [providers](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers) or methods you wish to support, along with any environment variables they require. auth.config.ts ```ts import GitHub from '@auth/core/providers/github'; import { defineConfig } from 'auth-astro'; export default defineConfig({ providers: [ GitHub({ clientId: import.meta.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, clientSecret: import.meta.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, }), ], }); ``` Create a `.env` file in the root of your project if it does not already exist. Add the following two environment variables. `AUTH_SECRET` should be a private string with a minimum of 32 characters. .env ```sh AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true AUTH_SECRET=<my-auth-secret> ``` ### Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) You can add sign-in and sign-out buttons using the `auth-astro/client` module in a script tag or client-side framework component. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Layout from 'src/layouts/Base.astro'; --- <Layout> <button id="login">Login</button> <button id="logout">Logout</button> <script> const { signIn, signOut } = await import("auth-astro/client") document.querySelector("#login").onclick = () => signIn("github") document.querySelector("#logout").onclick = () => signOut() </script> </Layout> ``` You can fetch the user’s session using the `getSession` method. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Layout from 'src/layouts/Base.astro'; import { getSession } from 'auth-astro/server'; export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode const session = await getSession(Astro.request); --- <Layout> { session ? ( <p>Welcome {session.user?.name}</p> ) : ( <p>Not logged in</p> ) } </Layout> ``` ### Next Steps [Section titled “Next Steps”](#next-steps) * [`auth-astro` on GitHub](https://github.com/nowaythatworked/auth-astro?tab=readme-ov-file#auth-astro) * [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/) ## Better Auth [Section titled “Better Auth”](#better-auth) Better Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. It supports Astro out of the box, and you can use it to add authentication to your astro project. ### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation-1) * npm ```shell npm install better-auth ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add better-auth ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add better-auth ``` For detailed setup instructions, check out the [Better Auth Installation Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation). ### Configuration [Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration-1) Configure your database table to store user data and your preferred authentication methods as described in the [Better Auth Installation Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#configure-database). Then, you’ll need to mount the Better Auth handler in your Astro project. src/pages/api/auth/\[...all].ts ```ts import { auth } from "../../../lib/auth"; // import your Better Auth instance import type { APIRoute } from "astro"; export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode export const ALL: APIRoute = async (ctx) => { return auth.handler(ctx.request); }; ``` Follow the [Better Auth Astro Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/astro) to learn more. ### Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage-1) Better Auth offers a `createAuthClient` helper for various frameworks, including Vanilla JS, React, Vue, Svelte, and Solid. For example, to create a client for React, import the helper from `'better-auth/react'`: * React src/lib/auth-client.ts ```ts import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/react'; export const authClient = createAuthClient(); export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient; ``` * Solid src/lib/auth-client.ts ```ts import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/solid'; export const authClient = createAuthClient(); export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient; ``` * Svelte src/lib/auth-client.ts ```ts import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/svelte'; export const authClient = createAuthClient(); export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient; ``` * Vue src/lib/auth-client.ts ```ts import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/vue'; export const authClient = createAuthClient(); export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient; ``` Once your client is set up, you can use it to authenticate users in your Astro components or any framework-specific files. The following example adds the ability to log in or log out with your configured `signIn()` and `signOut()` functions. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Layout from 'src/layouts/Base.astro'; --- <Layout> <button id="login">Login</button> <button id="logout">Logout</button> <script> const { signIn, signOut } = await import("./lib/auth-client") document.querySelector("#login").onclick = () => signIn.social({ provider: "github", callbackURL: "/dashboard", }) document.querySelector("#logout").onclick = () => signOut() </script> </Layout> ``` You can then use the `auth` object to get the user’s session data in your server-side code. The following example personalizes page content by displaying an authenticated user’s name: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { auth } from "../../../lib/auth"; // import your Better Auth instance export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: Astro.request.headers, }); --- <p>{session.user?.name}</p> ``` You can also use the `auth` object to protect your routes using middleware. The following example checks whether a user trying to access a logged-in dashboard route is authenticated, and redirects them to the home page if not. src/middleware.ts ```ts import { auth } from "../../../auth"; // import your Better Auth instance import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware"; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { const isAuthed = await auth.api .getSession({ headers: context.request.headers, }) if (context.url.pathname === "/dashboard" && !isAuthed) { return context.redirect("/"); } return next(); }); ``` ### Next Steps [Section titled “Next Steps”](#next-steps-1) * [Better Auth Astro Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/astro) * [Better Auth Astro Example](https://github.com/better-auth/examples/tree/main/astro-example) * [Better Auth Documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs) * [Better Auth GitHub Repository](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth) ## Clerk [Section titled “Clerk”](#clerk) Clerk is a complete suite of embeddable UIs, flexible APIs, and admin dashboards to authenticate and manage your users. An [official Clerk SDK for Astro](https://clerk.com/docs/references/astro/overview) is available. ### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation-2) Install `@clerk/astro` using the package manager of your choice. * npm ```shell npm install @clerk/astro ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add @clerk/astro ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add @clerk/astro ``` ### Configuration [Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration-2) Follow [Clerk’s own Astro Quickstart guide](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/astro) to set up Clerk integration and middleware in your Astro project. ### Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage-2) Clerk provides components that allow you to control the visibility of pages based on your user’s authentication state. Show logged out users a sign in button instead of the content available to users who are logged in: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Layout from 'src/layouts/Base.astro'; import { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton, SignInButton } from '@clerk/astro/components'; export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode --- <Layout> <SignedIn> <UserButton /> </SignedIn> <SignedOut> <SignInButton /> </SignedOut> </Layout> ``` Clerk also allows you to protect routes on the server using middleware. Specify which routes are protected, and prompt unauthenticated users to sign in: src/middleware.ts ```ts import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server'; const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([ '/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)', ]); export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => { if (!auth().userId && isProtectedRoute(context.request)) { return auth().redirectToSignIn(); } }); ``` ### Next Steps [Section titled “Next Steps”](#next-steps-2) * Read the [official `@clerk/astro` documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/astro/overview) * Start from a template with the [Clerk + Astro Quickstart project](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-astro-quickstart) ## Lucia [Section titled “Lucia”](#lucia) [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) is a resource for implementing session-based authentication in a number of frameworks, including Astro. ### Guides [Section titled “Guides”](#guides) 1. Create a [basic sessions API](https://lucia-auth.com/sessions/basic-api/) with your chosen database. 2. Add [session cookies](https://lucia-auth.com/sessions/cookies/astro) using endpoints and middleware. 3. Implement [GitHub OAuth](https://lucia-auth.com/tutorials/github-oauth/astro) using the APIs you implemented. ### Examples [Section titled “Examples”](#examples) * [GitHub OAuth example in Astro](https://github.com/lucia-auth/example-astro-github-oauth) * [Google OAuth example in Astro](https://github.com/lucia-auth/example-astro-google-oauth) * [Email and password example with 2FA in Astro](https://github.com/lucia-auth/example-astro-email-password-2fa) * [Email and password example with 2FA and WebAuthn in Astro](https://github.com/lucia-auth/example-astro-email-password-webauthn) ## Community Resources [Section titled “Community Resources”](#community-resources) * [Using Microsoft Entra Id EasyAuth with Astro and Azure Static Web App](https://agramont.net/blog/entra-id-easyauth-with-astro/)

# E-commerce

> An introduction to adding e-commerce options to your Astro site

With Astro, you can build several e-commerce options, from checkout links to hosted payment pages to building an entire storefront using a payment service API. ## Payment processing overlays [Section titled “Payment processing overlays”](#payment-processing-overlays) Some payment processing services (e.g. [Lemon Squeezy](#lemon-squeezy), [Paddle](#paddle)) add a payment form to allow your customer to purchase from your site. These can be hosted overlays or embedded in a page on your site. These may offer some basic customization or site branding, and may be added to your Astro project as scripts, buttons, or external links. ### Lemon Squeezy [Section titled “Lemon Squeezy”](#lemon-squeezy) [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/) is an all-in-one platform for payments and subscriptions with multi-currency support, global tax compliance, PayPal integration and more. It allows you to create and manage digital products and services through your account dashboard and provides product URLs for the checkout process. The basic [Lemon.js JavaScript library](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/what-is-lemonjs) allows you to sell your Lemon Squeezy products with a checkout link. #### Basic Usage [Section titled “Basic Usage”](#basic-usage) The following is an example of adding a Lemon Squeezy “Buy now” element to an Astro page. Clicking this link will open a checkout and allow the visitor to complete a single purchase. 1. Add the following `<script>` tag to your page `head` or `body`: src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <script src="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/js/lemon.js" defer></script> ``` 2. Create an anchor tag on the page linking to your product URL. Include the class `lemonsqueezy-button` to open a checkout overlay when clicked. src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <a class="lemonsqueezy-button" href="https://demo.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/..."> Buy Now </a> ``` #### Lemon.js [Section titled “Lemon.js”](#lemonjs) Lemon.js also provides additional behavior such as [programmatically opening overlays](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/opening-overlays) and [handling overlay events](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/handling-events). Read the [Lemon Squeezy developer getting started guide](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/developer-guide) for more information. ### Paddle [Section titled “Paddle”](#paddle) [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/) is a billing solution for digital products and services. It handles payments, taxes, and subscription management through an overlay or inline checkout. [Paddle.js](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/overview) is a lightweight JavaScript library that lets you build rich, integrated subscription billing experiences using Paddle. #### Basic Usage [Section titled “Basic Usage”](#basic-usage-1) The following is an example of adding a Paddle “Buy Now” element to an Astro page. Clicking this link will open a checkout and allow the visitor to complete a single purchase. After your default payment link domain (your own website) is approved by Paddle, you can turn any element on your page into a trigger for a checkout overlay using HTML data attributes. 1. Add the following two `<script>` tags to your page `head` or `body`: src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> Paddle.Setup({ token: '7d279f61a3499fed520f7cd8c08' // replace with a client-side token }); </script> ``` 2. Turn any element on your page into a Paddle Checkout button by adding the `paddle_button` class: src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <a href="#" class="paddle_button">Buy Now</a> ``` 3. Add a `data-items` attribute to specify your product’s Paddle `priceId` and `quantity`. You can also optionally pass additional [supported HTML data attributes](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/html-data-attributes) to prefill data, handle checkout success, or style your button and checkout overlay: src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <a href="#" class="paddle_button" data-display-mode="overlay" data-theme="light" data-locale="en" data-success-url="https://example.com/thankyou" data-items='[ { "priceId": "pri_01gs59hve0hrz6nyybj56z04eq", "quantity": 1 } ]' > Buy now </a> ``` #### Paddle.js [Section titled “Paddle.js”](#paddlejs) Instead of passing HTML data attributes, you can send data to the checkout overlay using JavaScript for passing multiple attributes and even greater customization. You can also create upgrade workflows using an inline checkout. Read more about [using Paddle.js to build an inline checkout](https://developer.paddle.com/build/checkout/build-branded-inline-checkout). ## Full-featured e-commerce solutions [Section titled “Full-featured e-commerce solutions”](#full-featured-e-commerce-solutions) For more customization over your site’s shopping cart and checkout process, you can connect a more fully-featured financial service provider (e.g. [Snipcart](#snipcart)) to your Astro project. These e-commerce platforms may also integrate with other third-party services for user account management, personalization, inventory and analytics. ### Snipcart [Section titled “Snipcart”](#snipcart) [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) is a powerful, developer-first HTML/JavaScript shopping cart platform. Snipcart also allows you to integrate with third-party services such as shipping providers, enable webhooks for an advanced e-commerce integration between your shopping cart and other systems, choose from several payment gateways (e.g. Stripe, Paypal, and Square), customize email templates, and even provides live testing environments. #### Basic Usage [Section titled “Basic Usage”](#basic-usage-2) The following is an example of configuring a Snipcart checkout and adding button elements for “Add to cart” and “Check out now” to an Astro page. This will allow your visitors to add products to a cart without being immediately sent to a checkout page. For complete instructions, including setting up your Snipcart store, please see [the Snipcart installation documentation](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/installation). 1. Add the script [as shown in the Snipcart installation instructions](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/installation) on your page after the `<body>` element. src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <body></body> <script> window.SnipcartSettings = { publicApiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", loadStrategy: "on-user-interaction", }; (function()...); // available from the Snipcart documentation </script> ``` 2. Customize `window.SnipcartSettings` with any of the [available Snipcart settings](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/installation#settings) to control the behavior and appearance of your cart. src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <script> window.SnipcartSettings = { publicApiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", loadStrategy: "manual", version: "3.7.1", addProductBehavior: "none", modalStyle: "side", }; (function()...); // available from the Snipcart documentation </script> ``` 3. Add `class="snipcart-add-item"` to any HTML element, such as a `<button>`, to add an item to the cart when clicked on. Also include any other data elements for [common Snipcart product attributes](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/products) such as price and description, and any optional fields. src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <button class="snipcart-add-item" data-item-id="astro-print" data-item-price="39.99" data-item-description="A framed print of the Astro logo." data-item-image="/assets/images/astro-print.jpg" data-item-name="Astro Print" data-item-custom1-name="Frame color" data-item-custom1-options="Brown|Silver[+10.00]|Gold[+20.00]" data-item-custom2-name="Delivery instructions" data-item-custom2-type="textarea" > Add to cart </button> ``` 4. Add a Snipcart checkout button with the `snipcart-checkout` class to open the cart and allow guests to complete their purchase with a checkout modal. src/pages/my-product-page.astro ```html <button class="snipcart-checkout">Click here to checkout</button> ``` #### Snipcart JavaScript SDK [Section titled “Snipcart JavaScript SDK”](#snipcart-javascript-sdk) The [Snipcart JavaScript SDK](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/sdk/basics) lets you configure, customize and manage your Snipcart cart programmatically. This allows you to perform actions such as: * Retrieve relevant information about the current Snipcart session and apply certain operations to the cart. * Listen to incoming events and trigger callbacks dynamically. * Listen to state changes and receive a full snapshot of the state of the cart. See the [Snipcart documentation](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/) for more information about all the options to integrate Snipcart with your Astro Project. #### `astro-snipcart` [Section titled “astro-snipcart”](#astro-snipcart) There are two `astro-snipcart` community packages that can simplify using Snipcart. * [`@lloydjatkinson/astro-snipcart` Astro template](https://astro-snipcart.vercel.app/): This Astro template includes an optional design system for a complete e-commerce solution out of the box. Learn more on its own extensive documentation site, including [the motivation behind building `astro-snipcart`](https://astro-snipcart.vercel.app/motivation) as providing a convenient, Astro-native way for you to interact with the Snipcart API. * [`@Adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart` integration](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart): This integration was heavily inspired by the `astro-snipcart` theme and provides Astro components (or Vue components) that you can add to your existing Astro project for creating products, controlling the cart, and more. See the [full tutorial](https://matthiesen.xyz/blog/getting-started-with-my-astro-snipcart-addon) for more information. ## Community Resources [Section titled “Community Resources”](#community-resources) * [Hands-On Experience: eCommerce Store with Astro?](https://crystallize.com/blog/building-ecommerce-with-astro) * [Collecting Payments with Stripe using Astro](https://zellwk.com/blog/stripe-astro-recipe/)

# Image and video hosting with Astro

> How to use a hosted media service to add images and videos to Astro

Follow one of our guides to integrate images and videos from a hosted media service. ## Hosted Media Guides [Section titled “Hosted Media Guides”](#hosted-media-guides) * ![](/logos/cloudinary.svg) ### [Cloudinary](/en/guides/media/cloudinary/) * ![](/logos/mux.svg) ### [Mux](/en/guides/media/mux/) ## Why use hosted media? [Section titled “Why use hosted media?”](#why-use-hosted-media) Hosted media helps individuals, teams, and organizations store, manage, optimize, and deliver their image and video assets with dedicated APIs from a central location. This centralization can be useful, particularly when using a single source of truth for your assets between multiple web or mobile properties. This is important if you’re part of an organization that requires multiple teams to use the same assets, or are integrating into other content systems like a PIM (Product Information Manager) to connect your assets to products. Image hosting services can transform and optimize your images, automatically delivering optimized versions for your visitors. These [remote images](/en/guides/images/#remote-images) can be used in Astro’s built-in `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components, and are available to all file types in your project, including Markdown, MDX, and UI Framework components. Video hosting services like [Mux](/en/guides/media/mux/) can provide performant on-demand and live-streaming video delivery along with customizable video players, giving significant reliability and scaling benefits over handling local content. They will handle video transcoding, compression, and transformation to provide a smooth user experience. A platform like Mux may also include data analysis to help you understand your user engagement. ## Which hosted media systems work well with Astro? [Section titled “Which hosted media systems work well with Astro?”](#which-hosted-media-systems-work-well-with-astro) Much like when using a CMS, you’ll want to use hosted services that allow you to fetch and interact with your assets via an API or SDK. Some services may additionally include Astro-native components for displaying your images or videos. ## Can I use Astro without a hosted media system? [Section titled “Can I use Astro without a hosted media system?”](#can-i-use-astro-without-a-hosted-media-system) Yes! Astro provides built-in ways to [store images](/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images), including support for referencing remote images. However, there is no native video support in Astro, and we recommend choosing a service like [Mux](/en/guides/media/mux/) to handle the demands of optimizing and streaming video content.

# Cloudinary & Astro

> Add images and videos to your Astro project using Cloudinary

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) is an image and video platform and headless Digital Asset Manager (DAM) that lets you host assets and deliver them from their content delivery network (CDN). When delivering from Cloudinary, you additionally get access to their Transformation API, giving you the ability to edit your assets with tools like background removal, dynamic cropping and resizing, and generative AI. ## Using Cloudinary in Astro [Section titled “Using Cloudinary in Astro”](#using-cloudinary-in-astro) Cloudinary supports a wide variety of SDKs that can be used depending on your Astro environment. The [Cloudinary Astro SDK](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/) provides native Astro components, including image, video, and upload components, as well as a content loader that can be used with Astro content collections. Alternatively, both the Cloudinary [Node.js SDK](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration) and [JavaScript SDK](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_integration) can be used to generate URLs for your images. The Node.js SDK can additionally make requests to the Cloudinary API including uploading assets, requesting resources, and running content analysis. ## Prerequisites [Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites) * An existing Astro project * A Cloudinary account ## Installing Astro Cloudinary [Section titled “Installing Astro Cloudinary”](#installing-astro-cloudinary) Install the Cloudinary Astro SDK by running the appropriate command for your package manager: * npm ```shell npm install astro-cloudinary ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add astro-cloudinary ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add astro-cloudinary ``` ## Configuring your account [Section titled “Configuring your account”](#configuring-your-account) Create a new `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Cloudinary credentials: .env ```shell PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="<Your Cloud Name>" // Only needed if using CldUploadWidget or cldAssetsLoader PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="<Your API Key>" CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="<Your API Secret>" ``` ## Using Cloudinary images [Section titled “Using Cloudinary images”](#using-cloudinary-images) Add images in `.astro` components by passing image data (e.g. `src`, `width`, `alt`) to the `<CldImage>` component. This will automatically optimize your image and give you access to the Transformations API. Component.astro ```jsx --- import { CldImage } from 'astro-cloudinary'; --- <CldImage src="<Public ID>" width="<Width>" height="<Height>" alt="<Description>" /> ``` See [Cloudinary’s `<CldImage>` documentation](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/cldimage/basic-usage) for more information. ## Using Cloudinary videos [Section titled “Using Cloudinary videos”](#using-cloudinary-videos) To add video to your `.astro` components, add the `<CldVideoPlayer>` and pass the appropriate properties. This component will automatically optimize and embed your video using the [Cloudinary Video Player](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player). Component.astro ```jsx --- import { CldVideoPlayer } from 'astro-cloudinary'; --- <CldVideoPlayer src="<Public ID>" width="<Width>" height="<Height>" /> ``` See [Cloudinary’s `<CldVideoPlayer>` documentation](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/cldvideoplayer/basic-usage) for more information. ## Enabling Cloudinary uploads [Section titled “Enabling Cloudinary uploads”](#enabling-cloudinary-uploads) To enable file uploading in your website or app’s UI, add the `<CldUploadWidget>` which will embed the [Cloudinary Upload Widget](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_widget). The following example creates a widget to allow unsigned uploads by passing an unsigned [Upload Preset](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets): Component.astro ```jsx --- import { CldUploadWidget } from 'astro-cloudinary'; --- <CldUploadWidget uploadPreset="<Upload Preset>"> <button>Upload</button> </CldUploadWidget> ``` For signed uploads, you can find [a guide and example](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/clduploadwidget/signed-uploads) on the Astro Cloudinary docs. See [Cloudinary’s `<CldUploadWidget>` documentation](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/clduploadwidget/basic-usage) for more information. ## Cloudinary content loader [Section titled “Cloudinary content loader”](#cloudinary-content-loader) The Cloudinary Astro SDK provides the `cldAssetsLoader` content loader to load Cloudinary assets for content collections. To load a collection of images or videos, set `loader: cldAssetsLoader ({})` with a `folder`, if required: config.ts ```jsx import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { cldAssetsLoader } from 'astro-cloudinary/loaders'; export const collections = { assets: defineCollection({ loader: cldAssetsLoader({ folder: '<Folder>' // Optional, without loads root directory }) }), } ``` You can then use the [`getCollection()` or `getEntry()` query functions](/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections) to select one or many images or videos from your collection. See [Cloudinary’s `cldAssetsLoader` documentation](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/cldassetsloader/basic-usage) for more information. ## Generating Cloudinary image URLs [Section titled “Generating Cloudinary image URLs”](#generating-cloudinary-image-urls) The Astro Cloudinary SDK provides a `getCldOgImageUrl()` helper for generating and using URLs for your images. Use this when you need a URL instead of a component to display your image. One common use for a URL is for an Open Graph image in `<meta>` tags for social media cards. This helper, like the components, provides you access to Cloudinary transformations to create dynamic, unique social cards for any of your pages. The following example shows the necessary `<meta>` tags for a social media card, using `getCldOgImageUrl()` to generate an Open Graph image: Layout.astro ```jsx --- import { getCldOgImageUrl } from 'astro-cloudinary/helpers'; const ogImageUrl = getCldOgImageUrl({ src: '<Public ID>' }); --- <meta property="og:image" content={ogImageUrl} /> <meta property="og:image:secure_url" content={ogImageUrl} /> <meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" /> <meta property="og:image:height" content="630" /> <meta property="twitter:title" content="<Twitter Title>" /> <meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" /> <meta property="twitter:image" content={ogImageUrl} /> ``` Find [Cloudinary Social Media Card templates](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/templates/social-media-cards) on the Cloudinary docs.

# Mux & Astro

> Add high-performance video to your Astro project using Mux

[Mux](https://www.mux.com?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) is a hosted media service that provides video streaming infrastructure and performance analytics for businesses of all scales. When you use Mux to store and host your video content, you’ll have access to Astro-native video components for [Mux Player](#mux-player), a drop-in component for adding Mux videos in your Astro project, and [Mux Uploader](#mux-uploader) for uploading videos to Mux from your website. These components integrate seamlessly with [Mux Data](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/data?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) to track your video engagement and performance. You can also interact with your content through the [Mux Node SDK](#mux-node-sdk). ## Using Mux in Astro [Section titled “Using Mux in Astro”](#using-mux-in-astro) Mux’s APIs and web components work in Astro to compress and optimize your videos and streams for the web, adapt the quality of your video to network conditions, and integrate additional features like captions, thumbnails, and analytics. The [Mux Node SDK](https://www.mux.com/docs/integrations/mux-node-sdk?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) supports both Mux Data and the Mux Video API. ## Prerequisites [Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites) * An existing Astro project. Some features may additionally require an adapter installed for [on-demand server rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/). * A Mux account. If you don’t have an account, you can [sign up with Mux](https://dashboard.mux.com/login?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) using the code `ASTRO` to receive a $50 credit. ## Mux Player [Section titled “Mux Player”](#mux-player) In Astro, you can use the full-featured [Mux Player](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-player-web?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) as a native Astro component for optimized, responsive video playback and live streams. Mux Player provides a responsive UI based on video player dimensions and stream type, automatic thumbnail previews and poster images, and modern video player capabilities (e.g. fullscreen, picture-in-picture, Chromecast, AirPlay). src/components/MyMuxVideoPlayer.astro ```astro --- import { MuxPlayer } from "@mux/mux-player-astro"; --- <MuxPlayer playbackId="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe" metadata={{ video_title: 'My Astro Video' }} /> ``` Mux Player has built-in support for Mux Data analytics, and will automatically show visitor engagement and video quality metrics in your dashboard once your video has views on your deployed site. ### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation) Install the Astro version of Mux Player using your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm install @mux/mux-player-astro ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add @mux/mux-player-astro ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add @mux/mux-player-astro ``` Mux Player can also be used in your Astro project as: * a web component (`<mux-player>` from `@mux/mux-player` ) * a React component (`<MuxPlayer />` from `@mux/mux-player-react`) * an HTML web embed (`<iframe>`) ### Play a video from Mux [Section titled “Play a video from Mux”](#play-a-video-from-mux) Import and use the native `<MuxPlayer />` Astro component directly in your `.astro` files like any other Astro component. You will need the `playbackId` for your asset, which can be found in your Mux dashboard or [retrieved from its `ASSET_ID`](#retrieve-asset-data). All other [options to control the Mux web player](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/player-api-reference/?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) (e.g. hide or display controls, style elements, disable cookies) are optional: src/components/StarlightVideo.astro ```astro <MuxPlayer playbackId="FOTbeIxKeMPzyhrob722wytaTGI02Y3zbV00NeFQbTbK00" metadata={{ video_title: 'Starlight by Astro', }} style={{ display: 'block', aspectRatio: '16/9', backgroundColor: '#000', margin: '1rem 0 2rem', }} primaryColor="#f2ec3a" secondaryColor="#0caa09" accentColor="#6e1e99" defaultShowRemainingTime={true} /> ``` If your `playbackId` belongs to a live stream instead of a prerecorded video on demand, then the Mux Player will allow you to further customize the player with options such as whether or not to enable [DVR mode](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/stream-recordings-of-live-streams#dvr-mode-vs-non-dvr-mode?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs). ```astro <MuxPlayer playbackId="FOTbeIxKeMPzyhrob722wytaTGI02Y3zbV00NeFQbTbK00" metadata={{ video_title: 'Starlight stream with Astro', }} streamType="live:dvr" /> ``` Every live stream is recorded and saved on Mux as a video asset for future on-demand playback. ## Mux video Element [Section titled “Mux video Element”](#mux-video-element) The [Mux video element](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/play-your-videos#mux-video-element?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) is a drop-in replacement for the HTML5 `<video>` element that provides browser support for HLS playback, and has Mux Data automatically configured to show visitor and performance metrics. Use this when you do not need or want all the features of [Mux Player](#mux-player). To use the `<mux-video>` web component, first install `mux-video` using your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm install @mux/mux-video ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add @mux/mux-video ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add @mux/mux-video ``` Then, you can import and render the web component in a `<script>` tag in your `.astro` file. You will need the `playback-id` for your video asset, which can be found in your Mux dashboard or [retrieved from its `ASSET_ID`](#retrieve-asset-data). All attributes for the HTML 5 `<video>` element (e.g. `poster`, `controls`, `muted`) are available, as well as additional Mux video player controls (e.g. to provide metadata, control the resolution, disable cookies): src/components/StarlightVideo.astro ```astro <script>import '@mux/mux-video'</script> <mux-video playback-id="FOTbeIxKeMPzyhrob722wytaTGI02Y3zbV00NeFQbTbK00" metadata-video-title="Starlight by Astro" controls disable-tracking ></mux-video> ``` ## Mux Node SDK [Section titled “Mux Node SDK”](#mux-node-sdk) The [Mux Node SDK](https://www.mux.com/docs/integrations/mux-node-sdk?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) provides authenticated access to the Mux REST API from server-side TypeScript or JavaScript. This allows you to interact with your Mux assets and data in the component script of your `.astro` files. While the Mux Player and Mux Video components do not require authentication and can play any publicly accessible video given its `playbackId`, connecting to your hosted Mux data via the Node SDK requires [a Mux API access token](#mux-environment-api-access). ### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation-1) Install the Mux Node SDK using your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm install @mux/mux-node ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add @mux/mux-node ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add @mux/mux-node ``` ### Mux Environment API access [Section titled “Mux Environment API access”](#mux-environment-api-access) API tokens are tied to a specific Mux Environment, which is essentially a container for your videos and related data. When you sign up for Mux, an Environment is created for you automatically. If you’ve created additional Environments, make sure you select the correct one before generating your tokens. From there, you can [get your ID and SECRET tokens](https://www.mux.com/docs/core/stream-video-files#1-get-an-api-access-token) and provide them to the Node SDK. These tokens can be passed into your Astro components as environment variables stored in a `.env` file. This will allow you to create an instance of the Mux Node SDK for retrieving information about your videos, creating new assets, accessing metrics and real-time performance, and more: src/components/StarlightVideo.astro ```astro --- import Mux from "@mux/mux-node"; const mux = new Mux ({ tokenId: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID, tokenSecret: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET, }) --- ``` Read more about using [environment variables](/en/guides/environment-variables/) in your Astro project, including creating a [type-safe schema](/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables) for your Mux credentials. ### Retrieve asset data [Section titled “Retrieve asset data”](#retrieve-asset-data) To fetch information about your video to use in your Astro project, provide the video’s `ASSET_ID` (available in the Mux dashboard) to the `retrieve()` helper function. This will allow you to pass values to both your Mux components and your HTML template, such as the video’s title or duration: ```astro --- import Mux from "@mux/mux-node"; import { MuxPlayer } from "@mux/mux-player-astro"; const mux = new Mux({ tokenId: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID, tokenSecret: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET, }) const ASSET_ID = "E01irAaN8c6dk1010153uC2mzst7RVbAdJJWtHECAHFvDo"; const asset = await mux.video.assets.retrieve(ASSET_ID); const playbackId = asset.playback_ids?.find((id)=> id.policy=== "public")?.id; const videoTitle = asset?.meta?.title; const createdAt = Number(asset?.created_at); const duration = Number(asset?.duration) const date = new Date(createdAt * 1000).toDateString() const time = new Date(Math.round(duration) * 1000).toISOString().substring(14, 19) --- <h1>My Video Page</h1> <p>Title: {videoTitle}</p> <p>Upload Date: {date}</p> <p>Length: {time}</p> <MuxPlayer playbackId={playbackId} metadata={{video_title: videoTitle}} /> ``` See all asset properties in the [Mux Asset API documentation](https://www.mux.com/docs/api-reference/video/assets?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs). ## Mux Uploader [Section titled “Mux Uploader”](#mux-uploader) [Mux Uploader](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-uploader?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) is a fully-functional, customizable video upload UI for your Astro website. The native Astro `<MuxUpload />` component allows you to build video upload functionality into your web app. Mux Uploader supports both manual file selection and drag and drop for file uploads, optional pausing and resuming of uploads, and more. ### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation-2) Install the Astro version of Mux Uploader using your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm install @mux/mux-uploader-astro ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add @mux/mux-uploader-astro ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add @mux/mux-uploader-astro ``` ### Upload a video to Mux [Section titled “Upload a video to Mux”](#upload-a-video-to-mux) Before uploading a video, make sure you have your [Mux API access tokens](#mux-environment-api-access) configured. With those in place, you can use the `create()` function from the Mux Node SDK to start a new video upload: ```astro --- import Layout from '../../layouts/Layout.astro'; import Mux from "@mux/mux-node"; import { MuxUploader } from "@mux/mux-uploader-astro"; const mux = new Mux({ tokenId: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID, tokenSecret: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET }); const upload = await mux.video.uploads.create({ new_asset_settings: { playback_policy: ['public'], video_quality: 'basic' }, cors_origin: '*', }); --- <Layout title="Upload a video to Mux"> <MuxUploader endpoint={upload.url} /> </Layout> ``` ### Customize the uploader [Section titled “Customize the uploader”](#customize-the-uploader) You can customize the functionality and appearance of the `<MuxUploader />` with additional component attributes. In addition to styling your element, this allows you to control options such as the ability to pause a download or set a maximum file size. ```astro --- import { MuxUploader } from '@mux/mux-uploader-astro'; --- <MuxUploader endpoint="https://my-authenticated-url/storage?your-url-params" pausable maxFileSize={1000000000} chunkSize={8192} style={{ '--progress-bar-fill-color': '#7e22ce', '--button-background-color': '#f0f0f0', }} /> ``` See the [Mux Uploader customization guide](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/uploader-web-customize-look-and-feel?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) for more options. ### Event handling for uploads [Section titled “Event handling for uploads”](#event-handling-for-uploads) Mux Uploader provides a feature-rich, dynamic UI that changes based on the current state of your media upload. The uploader’s behavior responds to both user-driven events (e.g. selecting a file, retrying after an error) and state-driven events (e.g. upload in-progress, upload successfully completed). You can listen for these events and handle them in your Astro component with [client-side scripts](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/). A `MuxUploaderElement` type is also available. ```astro --- import { MuxUploader } from '@mux/mux-uploader-astro'; --- <MuxUploader id="my-uploader" endpoint="https://my-authenticated-url/storage?your-url-params" pausable /> <script> import type { MuxUploaderElement } from '@mux/mux-uploader-astro'; const uploader = document.getElementById('my-uploader') as MuxUploaderElement; uploader.addEventListener('uploadstart', (event) => { console.log('Upload started!', event.detail); }); uploader.addEventListener('success', (event) => { console.log('Upload successful!', event.detail); }); uploader.addEventListener('uploaderror', (event) => { console.error('Upload error!', event.detail); }); uploader.addEventListener('progress', (event) => { console.log('Upload progress: ', event.detail); }); </script> ``` ## Official Resources [Section titled “Official Resources”](#official-resources) For the full API and webhook reference, usage guides, and information about additional topics, such as integrating with a CMS, building custom video workflows, and more, please see: * [The official Mux documentation for Astro](https://www.mux.com/docs/integrations/astro?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro\&utm_source=astro-docs) * [`@mux/mux-player-astro` API reference](https://github.com/muxinc/elements/blob/main/packages/mux-player-astro/README.md) * [`@mux/mux-uploader-astro` API reference](https://github.com/muxinc/elements/blob/main/packages/mux-uploader-astro/REFERENCE.md) * [Building a video uploader with Mux and Astro (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaL1k5FsWfE) * [Astro uploader and player code example (GitHub)](https://github.com/muxinc/examples/tree/main/astro-uploader-and-player)

# Testing

> An intro to testing in Astro

Testing helps you write and maintain working Astro code. Astro supports many popular tools for unit tests, component tests, and end-to-end tests including Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, [Cypress](https://cypress.io) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). You can even install framework-specific testing libraries such as React Testing Library to test your UI framework components. Testing frameworks allow you to state **assertions** or **expectations** about how your code should behave in specific situations, then compare these to the actual behavior of your current code. ## Unit and integration tests [Section titled “Unit and integration tests”](#unit-and-integration-tests) ### Vitest [Section titled “Vitest”](#vitest) A Vite-native unit test framework with ESM, TypeScript and JSX support powered by esbuild. Use Astro’s `getViteConfig()` helper in your [`vitest.config.ts` configuration file](https://vitest.dev/config/) to set up Vitest with your Astro project’s settings: vitest.config.ts ```js /// <reference types="vitest" /> import { getViteConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default getViteConfig({ test: { // Vitest configuration options }, }); ``` By default, `getViteConfig()` will try to load an Astro config file in your project and apply it to the test environment. As of Astro 4.8, if you need to customize the Astro configuration applied in your tests, pass a second argument to `getViteConfig()`: ```js export default getViteConfig( { test: { /* Vitest configuration options */ } }, { site: 'https://example.com/', trailingSlash: 'always', }, ); ``` See the [Astro + Vitest starter template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/with-vitest) on GitHub. #### Vitest and Container API [Section titled “Vitest and Container API”](#vitest-and-container-api) **Added in:** `astro@4.9.0` You can natively test Astro components using the [container API](/en/reference/container-reference/). First, setup [`vitest` as explained above](#vitest), then create a `.test.js` file to test your component: example.test.js ```js import { experimental_AstroContainer as AstroContainer } from 'astro/container'; import { expect, test } from 'vitest'; import Card from '../src/components/Card.astro'; test('Card with slots', async () => { const container = await AstroContainer.create(); const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { slots: { default: 'Card content', }, }); expect(result).toContain('This is a card'); expect(result).toContain('Card content'); }); ``` ## End-to-end tests [Section titled “End-to-end tests”](#end-to-end-tests) ### Playwright [Section titled “Playwright”](#playwright) Playwright is an end-to-end testing framework for modern web apps. Use the Playwright API in JavaScript or TypeScript to test your Astro code on all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. #### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation) You can get started and run your tests using the [VS Code Extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode). Alternatively, you can install Playwright within your Astro project using the package manager of your choice. Follow the CLI steps to choose JavaScript/TypeScript, name your test folder, and add an optional GitHub Actions workflow. * npm ```shell npm init playwright@latest ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm create playwright ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn create playwright ``` #### Create your first Playwright test [Section titled “Create your first Playwright test”](#create-your-first-playwright-test) 1. Choose a page to test. This example will test the example page `index.astro` below. src/pages/index.astro ```html --- --- <html lang="en"> <head> <title>Astro is awesome!</title> <meta name="description" content="Pull content from anywhere and serve it fast with Astro's next-gen islands architecture." /> </head> <body></body> </html> ``` 2. Create a new folder and add the following test file in `src/test`. Copy and paste the following test into the file to verify that the page meta information is correct. Update the value of the page `<title>` to match the page you are testing. src/test/index.spec.ts ```jsx import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'; test('meta is correct', async ({ page }) => { await page.goto("http://localhost:4321/"); await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Astro is awesome!'); }); ``` #### Running your Playwright tests [Section titled “Running your Playwright tests”](#running-your-playwright-tests) You can run a single test or several tests at once, testing one or multiple browsers. By default, your test results will be shown in the terminal. Optionally, you can open the HTML Test Reporter to show a full report and filter test results. 1. To run our test from the previous example using the command line, use the `test` command. Optionally, include the file name to run just the single test: ```sh npx playwright test index.spec.ts ``` 2. To see the full HTML Test Report, open it using the following command: ```sh npx playwright show-report ``` ##### Advanced: Launching a development web server during the tests [Section titled “Advanced: Launching a development web server during the tests”](#advanced-launching-a-development-web-server-during-the-tests) You can also have Playwright start your server when you run your testing script by using the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-advanced#launching-a-development-web-server-during-the-tests) option in the Playwright configuration file. Here is an example of the configuration and commands required when using npm: 1. Add a test script to your `package.json` file in the project root, such as `"test:e2e": "playwright test"`. 2. In `playwright.config.ts`, add the `webServer` object and update the command value to `npm run preview`. playwright.config.ts ```diff import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'; export default defineConfig({ + webServer: { + command: 'npm run preview', + url: 'http://localhost:4321/', + timeout: 120 * 1000, + reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI, + }, use: { baseURL: 'http://localhost:4321/', }, }); ``` 3. Run `npm run build`, then run `npm run test:e2e` to run the Playwright tests. More information about Playwright can be found in the links below: * [Getting started with Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) * [Use a development server](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver#configuring-a-web-server) ### Cypress [Section titled “Cypress”](#cypress) Cypress is a front-end testing tool built for the modern web. Cypress enables you to write end-to-end tests for your Astro site. #### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation-1) You can install Cypress using the package manager of your choice. This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project. * npm ```shell npm install cypress --save-dev ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add --save-dev cypress ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add cypress --dev ``` #### Configuration [Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration) In the root of your project, create a `cypress.config.js` file with the following content: cypress.config.js ```js import { defineConfig } from 'cypress' export default defineConfig({ e2e: { supportFile: false } }) ``` #### Create your first Cypress test [Section titled “Create your first Cypress test”](#create-your-first-cypress-test) 1. Choose a page to test. This example will test the example page `index.astro` below. src/pages/index.astro ```html --- --- <html lang="en"> <head> <title>Astro is awesome!</title> <meta name="description" content="Pull content from anywhere and serve it fast with Astro's next-gen islands architecture." /> </head> <body> <h1>Hello world from Astro</h1> </body> </html> ``` 2. Create an `index.cy.js` file in the `cypress/e2e` folder. Use the following test in the file to verify that the page title and header are correct. cypress/e2e/index.cy.js ```js it('titles are correct', () => { const page = cy.visit('http://localhost:4321'); page.get('title').should('have.text', 'Astro is awesome!') page.get('h1').should('have.text', 'Hello world from Astro'); }); ``` #### Running your Cypress tests [Section titled “Running your Cypress tests”](#running-your-cypress-tests) Cypress can be run from the command line or from the Cypress App. The App provides a visual interface for running and debugging your tests. First, start the dev server so Cypress can access your live site. To run our test from the previous example using the command line, execute the following command: ```shell npx cypress run ``` Alternatively, to run the test using the Cypress App, execute the following command: ```shell npx cypress open ``` Once the Cypress App is launched, choose **E2E Testing**, then select the browser to be used to run tests. Once the test run is finished, you should see green check marks in the output confirming that your test passed: Output from npx cypress run ```shell Running: index.cy.js (1 of 1) ✓ titles are correct (107ms) 1 passing (1s) ``` #### Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) More information about Cypress can be found in the links below: * [Introduction to Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress) * [Testing Your App](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/testing-your-app) ### NightwatchJS [Section titled “NightwatchJS”](#nightwatchjs) Nightwatch.js is a test automation framework with a powerful set of tools to write, run, and debug your tests across the web with built-in support for all major browsers and their mobile equivalents, as well as native mobile applications. #### Installation [Section titled “Installation”](#installation-2) You can install NightwatchJS within your Astro project using the package manager of your choice. Follow the CLI steps to choose JavaScript/TypeScript, name your test folder, and select whether or not to include component testing and testing on mobile browsers. * npm ```shell npm init nightwatch@latest ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm create nightwatch ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn create nightwatch ``` #### Create your first Nightwatch test [Section titled “Create your first Nightwatch test”](#create-your-first-nightwatch-test) 1. Choose a page to test. This example will test the example page `index.astro` below. src/pages/index.astro ```html --- --- <html lang="en"> <head> <title>Astro is awesome!</title> <meta name="description" content="Pull content from anywhere and serve it fast with Astro's next-gen islands architecture." /> </head> <body></body> </html> ``` 2. Create a new folder `src/test/` and add the following test file: src/test/index.js ```js describe('Astro testing with Nightwatch', function () { before(browser => browser.navigateTo('http://localhost:4321/')); it("check that the title is correct", function (browser) { browser.assert.titleEquals('Astro is awesome!') }); after(browser => browser.end()); }); ``` #### Running your NightwatchJS tests [Section titled “Running your NightwatchJS tests”](#running-your-nightwatchjs-tests) You can run a single test or several tests at once, testing one or multiple browsers. By default, your test results will be shown in the terminal. Optionally, you can open the HTML Test Reporter to show a full report and filter test results. You can run the tests with the [NightwatchJS VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=browserstackcom.nightwatch) or using the CLI steps below: 1. To run all tests, enter the following command in the terminal. Optionally, include the file name to run just the single test: ```sh npx nightwatch test/index.js ``` Additionally, you can run the tests against a specific browser using the `--environment` or `-e` CLI argument. If you don’t have the relevant browser installed, Nightwatch will attempt to set it up for you using [Selenium Manager](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/introducing-selenium-manager/): ```sh npx nightwatch test/index.ts -e firefox ``` 2. To see the full HTML Test Report, open it using the following command: ```sh npx nightwatch test/index.ts --open ``` More information about NightwatchJS can be found in the links below: * [Intro to Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/overview/what-is-nightwatch.html) * [Testing with Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/writing-tests/introduction.html)
