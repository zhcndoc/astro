# Imports reference

> Learn how to import different file types into your Astro project.

Astro supports most static assets with zero configuration required. You can use the `import` statement anywhere in your project JavaScript (including your Astro frontmatter) and Astro will include a built, optimized copy of that static asset in your final build. `@import` is also supported inside of CSS & `<style>` tags. ## Supported File Types [Section titled “Supported File Types”](#supported-file-types) The following file types are supported out-of-the-box by Astro: * Astro Components (`.astro`) * Markdown (`.md`, `.markdown`, etc.) * JavaScript (`.js`, `.mjs`) * TypeScript (`.ts`) * NPM Packages * JSON (`.json`) * CSS (`.css`) * CSS Modules (`.module.css`) * Images & Assets (`.svg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) Additionally, you can extend Astro to add support for different [UI Frameworks](/en/guides/framework-components/) like React, Svelte and Vue components. You can also install the [Astro MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) or the [Astro Markdoc integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) to use `.mdx` or `.mdoc` files in your project. ### Files in `public/` [Section titled “Files in public/”](#files-in-public) You can place any static asset in the [`public/` directory](/en/basics/project-structure/#public) of your project, and Astro will copy it directly into your final build untouched. `public/` files are not built or bundled by Astro, which means that any type of file is supported. You can reference a `public/` file by a URL path directly in your HTML templates. ```astro // To link to /public/reports/annual/2024.pdf Download the <a href="/reports/annual/2024.pdf">2024 annual statement as a PDF</a>. // To display /public/assets/cats/ginger.jpg <img src="/assets/cats/ginger.jpg" alt="An orange cat sleeping on a bed."> ``` ## Import statements [Section titled “Import statements”](#import-statements) Astro uses ESM, the same [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#syntax) and [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) syntax supported in the browser. ### JavaScript [Section titled “JavaScript”](#javascript) ```js import { getUser } from './user.js'; ``` JavaScript can be imported using normal ESM `import` & `export` syntax. ### TypeScript [Section titled “TypeScript”](#typescript) ```js import { getUser } from './user'; import type { UserType } from './user'; ``` Astro includes built-in support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You can import `.ts` and `.tsx` files directly in your Astro project, and even write TypeScript code directly inside your [Astro component script](/en/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script) and any [script tags](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/). **Astro doesn’t perform any type checking itself.** Type checking should be taken care of outside of Astro, either by your IDE or through a separate script. For type checking Astro files, the [`astro check` command](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-check) is provided. Read more about [TypeScript support in Astro](/en/guides/typescript/). ### NPM Packages [Section titled “NPM Packages”](#npm-packages) If you’ve installed an NPM package, you can import it in Astro. ```astro --- import { Icon } from 'astro-icon'; --- ``` If a package was published using a legacy format, Astro will try to convert the package to ESM so that `import` statements work. In some cases, you may need to adjust your [`vite` config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#vite) for it to work. Caution Some packages rely on a browser environment. Astro components runs on the server, so importing these packages in the frontmatter may [lead to errors](/en/guides/troubleshooting/#document-or-window-is-not-defined). ### JSON [Section titled “JSON”](#json) ```js // Load the JSON object via the default export import json from './data.json'; ``` Astro supports importing JSON files directly into your application. Imported files return the full JSON object in the default import. ### CSS [Section titled “CSS”](#css) ```js // Load and inject 'style.css' onto the page import './style.css'; ``` Astro supports importing CSS files directly into your application. Imported styles expose no exports, but importing one will automatically add those styles to the page. This works for all CSS files by default, and can support compile-to-CSS languages like Sass & Less via plugins. Read more about advanced CSS import use cases such as a direct URL reference for a CSS file, or importing CSS as a string in the [Styling guide](/en/guides/styling/#advanced). ### CSS Modules [Section titled “CSS Modules”](#css-modules) ```jsx // 1. Converts './style.module.css' classnames to unique, scoped values. // 2. Returns an object mapping the original classnames to their final, scoped value. import styles from './style.module.css'; // This example uses JSX, but you can use CSS Modules with any framework. return <div className={styles.error}>Your Error Message</div>; ``` Astro supports CSS Modules using the `[name].module.css` naming convention. Like any CSS file, importing one will automatically apply that CSS to the page. However, CSS Modules export a special default `styles` object that maps your original classnames to unique identifiers. CSS Modules help you enforce component scoping & isolation on the frontend with uniquely-generated class names for your stylesheets. ### Other Assets [Section titled “Other Assets”](#other-assets) ```jsx // Returns an object with `src` and other properties import imgReference from './image.png'; import svgReference from './image.svg'; // HTML or UI Framework components use this to render the image <img src={imgReference.src} alt="image description" />; // The Astro `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components access `src` by default <Image src={imgReference} alt="image description"> ``` All other assets not explicitly mentioned above can be imported via ESM `import` and will return a URL reference to the final built asset (e.g. `/_astro/my-video.C7vXpQtF.mp4`) instead of an object. This can be useful for referencing non-JS assets by URL, like creating a video element with a `src` attribute pointing to that image. It can also be useful to place images and other assets in the `public/` folder as explained on the [project-structure page](/en/basics/project-structure/#public). Read more about appending Vite import parameters (e.g. `?url`, `?raw`) in [Vite’s static asset handling guide](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html). ## Aliases [Section titled “Aliases”](#aliases) An **alias** is a way to create shortcuts for your imports. Aliases can help improve the development experience in codebases with many directories or relative imports. src/pages/about/company.astro ```astro --- import Button from '../../components/controls/Button.astro'; import logoUrl from '../../assets/logo.png?url'; --- ``` In this example, a developer would need to understand the tree relationship between `src/pages/about/company.astro`, `src/components/controls/Button.astro`, and `src/assets/logo.png`. And then, if the `company.astro` file were to be moved, these imports would also need to be updated. You can add import aliases in `tsconfig.json`. tsconfig.json ```diff { "compilerOptions": { "paths": { +"@components/*": ["./src/components/*"], +"@assets/*": ["./src/assets/*"] } } } ``` The development server will automatically restart after this configuration change. You can now import using the aliases anywhere in your project: src/pages/about/company.astro ```astro --- import Button from '@components/controls/Button.astro'; import logoUrl from '@assets/logo.png?url'; --- ``` ## `import.meta.glob()` [Section titled “import.meta.glob()”](#importmetaglob) [Vite’s `import.meta.glob()`](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import) is a way to import many files at once using glob patterns to find matching file paths. `import.meta.glob()` takes a relative [glob pattern](#glob-patterns) matching the local files you’d like to import as a parameter. It returns an array of each matching file’s exports. To load all matched modules up front, pass `{ eager: true }` as the second argument: src/components/my-component.astro ```astro --- // imports all files that end with `.md` in `./src/pages/post/` const matches = import.meta.glob('../pages/post/*.md', { eager: true }); const posts = Object.values(matches); --- <!-- Renders an <article> for the first 5 blog posts --> <div> {posts.slice(0, 4).map((post) => ( <article> <h2>{post.frontmatter.title}</h2> <p>{post.frontmatter.description}</p> <a href={post.url}>Read more</a> </article> ))} </div> ``` Astro components imported using `import.meta.glob` are of type [`AstroInstance`](#astro-files). You can render each component instance using its `default` property: src/pages/component-library.astro ```astro --- // imports all files that end with `.astro` in `./src/components/` const components = Object.values(import.meta.glob('../components/*.astro', { eager: true })); --- <!-- Display all of our components --> {components.map((component) => ( <div> <component.default size={24} /> </div> ))} ``` ### Supported Values [Section titled “Supported Values”](#supported-values) Vite’s `import.meta.glob()` function only supports static string literals. It does not support dynamic variables and string interpolation. A common workaround is to instead import a larger set of files that includes all the files you need, then filter them: src/components/featured.astro ```astro --- const { postSlug } = Astro.props; const pathToMyFeaturedPost = `src/pages/blog/${postSlug}.md`; const posts = Object.values(import.meta.glob("../pages/blog/*.md", { eager: true })); const myFeaturedPost = posts.find(post => post.file.includes(pathToMyFeaturedPost)); --- <p> Take a look at my favorite post, <a href={myFeaturedPost.url}>{myFeaturedPost.frontmatter.title}</a>! </p> ``` ### Import type utilities [Section titled “Import type utilities”](#import-type-utilities) #### Markdown files [Section titled “Markdown files”](#markdown-files) Markdown files loaded with `import.meta.glob()` return the following `MarkdownInstance` interface: ```ts export interface MarkdownInstance<T extends Record<string, any>> { /* Any data specified in this file's YAML/TOML frontmatter */ frontmatter: T; /* The absolute file path of this file */ file: string; /* The rendered path of this file */ url: string | undefined; /* Astro Component that renders the contents of this file */ Content: AstroComponentFactory; /** (Markdown only) Raw Markdown file content, excluding layout HTML and YAML/TOML frontmatter */ rawContent(): string; /** (Markdown only) Markdown file compiled to HTML, excluding layout HTML */ compiledContent(): string; /* Function that returns an array of the h1...h6 elements in this file */ getHeadings(): Promise<{ depth: number; slug: string; text: string }[]>; default: AstroComponentFactory; } ``` You can optionally provide a type for the `frontmatter` variable using a TypeScript generic. ```astro --- import type { MarkdownInstance } from 'astro'; interface Frontmatter { title: string; description?: string; } const posts = Object.values(import.meta.glob<MarkdownInstance<Frontmatter>>('./posts/**/*.md', { eager: true })); --- <ul> {posts.map(post => <li>{post.frontmatter.title}</li>)} </ul> ``` #### Astro files [Section titled “Astro files”](#astro-files) Astro files have the following interface: ```ts export interface AstroInstance { /* The file path of this file */ file: string; /* The URL for this file (if it is in the pages directory) */ url: string | undefined; default: AstroComponentFactory; } ``` #### Other files [Section titled “Other files”](#other-files) Other files may have various different interfaces, but `import.meta.glob()` accepts a TypeScript generic if you know exactly what an unrecognized file type contains. ```ts --- interface CustomDataFile { default: Record<string, any>; } const data = import.meta.glob<CustomDataFile>('../data/**/*.js'); --- ``` ### Glob Patterns [Section titled “Glob Patterns”](#glob-patterns) A glob pattern is a file path that supports special wildcard characters. This is used to reference multiple files in your project at once. For example, the glob pattern `./pages/**/*.{md,mdx}` starts within the pages subdirectory, looks through all of its subdirectories (`/**`), and matches any filename (`/*`) that ends in either `.md` or `.mdx` (`.{md,mdx}`). #### Glob Patterns in Astro [Section titled “Glob Patterns in Astro”](#glob-patterns-in-astro) To use with `import.meta.glob()`, the glob pattern must be a string literal and cannot contain any variables. Additionally, glob patterns must begin with one of the following: * `./` (to start in the current directory) * `../` (to start in the parent directory) * `/` (to start at the root of the project) [Read more about the glob pattern syntax](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features). ### `import.meta.glob()` vs `getCollection()` [Section titled “import.meta.glob() vs getCollection()”](#importmetaglob-vs-getcollection) [Content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) provide a [`getCollection()` API](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getcollection) for loading multiple files instead of `import.meta.glob()`. If your content files (e.g. Markdown, MDX, Markdoc) are located in collections within the `src/content/` directory, use `getCollection()` to [query a collection](/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections) and return content entries. ## WASM [Section titled “WASM”](#wasm) ```js // Loads and initializes the requested WASM file const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('/example.wasm')); ``` Astro supports loading WASM files directly into your application using the browser’s [`WebAssembly`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly) API. ## Node Builtins [Section titled “Node Builtins”](#node-builtins) Astro supports Node.js built-ins, with some limitations, using Node’s newer `node:` prefix. There may be differences between development and production, and some features may be incompatible with on-demand rendering. Some [adapters](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) may also be incompatible with these built-ins modules or require configuration to support a subset (e.g., [Cloudflare Workers](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) or [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno-astro-adapter)). The following example imports the `util` module from Node to parse a media type (MIME): src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- // Example: import the "util" built-in from Node.js import util from 'node:util'; export interface Props { mimeType: string, } const mime = new util.MIMEType(Astro.props.mimeType) --- <span>Type: {mime.type}</span> <span>SubType: {mime.subtype}</span> ``` ## Extending file type support [Section titled “Extending file type support”](#extending-file-type-support) With **Vite** and compatible **Rollup** plugins, you can import file types which aren’t natively supported by Astro. Learn where to find the plugins you need in the [Finding Plugins](https://vite.dev/guide/using-plugins.html#finding-plugins) section of the Vite Documentation. ![](/houston_chef.webp) **Related recipe:** [Installing a Vite or Rollup plugin](/en/recipes/add-yaml-support/)

# Astro Adapter API

Astro is designed to make it easy to deploy to any cloud provider for on-demand rendering, also known as server-side rendering (SSR). This ability is provided by **adapters**, which are [integrations](/en/reference/integrations-reference/). See the [on-demand rendering guide](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) to learn how to use an existing adapter. ## What is an adapter? [Section titled “What is an adapter?”](#what-is-an-adapter) An adapter is a special kind of [integration](/en/reference/integrations-reference/) that provides an entrypoint for server rendering at request time. An adapter has access to the full Integration API and does two things: * Implements host-specific APIs for handling requests. * Configures the build according to host conventions. ## Building an adapter [Section titled “Building an adapter”](#building-an-adapter) Create an integration and call the `setAdapter()` function in the [`astro:config:done`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astroconfigdone) hook. This allows you to define a server entrypoint and the features supported by your adapter. The following example creates an adapter with a server entrypoint and stable support for Astro static output: my-adapter.mjs ```js export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', supportedAstroFeatures: { staticOutput: 'stable' } }); }, }, }; } ``` The `setAdapter()` function accepts an object containing the following properties: ### `name` [Section titled “name”](#name) **Type:** `string` Defines a unique name for your adapter. This will be used for logging. ### `serverEntrypoint` [Section titled “serverEntrypoint”](#serverentrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` Defines the entrypoint for on-demand rendering. Learn more about [building a server entrypoint](#building-a-server-entrypoint). ### `supportedAstroFeatures` [Section titled “supportedAstroFeatures”](#supportedastrofeatures) **Type:** `AstroAdapterFeatureMap` **Added in:** `astro@3.0.0` A map of Astro’s built-in features supported by the adapter. This allows Astro to determine which features an adapter supports, so appropriate error messages can be provided. Discover the [available Astro features](#astro-features) that an adapter can configure. ### `adapterFeatures` [Section titled “adapterFeatures”](#adapterfeatures) **Type:** `AstroAdapterFeatures` **Added in:** `astro@3.0.0` An object that specifies which [adapter features that change the build output](#adapter-features) are supported by the adapter. ### `args` [Section titled “args”](#args) **Type:** `any` A JSON-serializable value that will be passed to the adapter’s server entrypoint at runtime. This is useful to pass an object containing build-time configuration (e.g. paths, secrets) to your server runtime code. The following example defines an `args` object with a property that identifies where assets generated by Astro are located: my-adapter.mjs ```js export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ config, setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', args: { assets: config.build.assets } }); }, }, }; } ``` ### `client` [Section titled “client”](#client) **Type:** `{ internalFetchHeaders?: Record<string, string> | () => Record<string, string>; assetQueryParams?: URLSearchParams; }` **Added in:** `astro@5.15.0` A configuration object for Astro’s client-side code. #### `internalFetchHeaders` [Section titled “internalFetchHeaders”](#internalfetchheaders) **Type:** `Record<string, string> | () => Record<string, string>` Defines the headers to inject into Astro’s internal fetch calls (e.g. Actions, View Transitions, Server Islands, Prefetch). This can be an object of headers or a function that returns headers. The following example retrieves a `DEPLOY_ID` from the environment variables and, if provided, returns an object with the header name as key and the deploy id as value: my-adapter.mjs ```js export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ config, setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', client: { internalFetchHeaders: () => { const deployId = process.env.DEPLOY_ID; return deployId ? { 'Your-Header-ID': deployId } : {}; }, }, }); }, }, }; } ``` #### `assetQueryParams` [Section titled “assetQueryParams”](#assetqueryparams) **Type:** `URLSearchParams` Defines the query parameters to append to all asset URLs (e.g. images, stylesheets, scripts). This is useful for adapters that need to track deployment versions or other metadata. The following example retrieves a `DEPLOY_ID` from the environment variables and, if provided, returns an object with a custom search parameter name as key and the deploy id as value: my-adapter.mjs ```js export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ config, setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', client: { assetQueryParams: process.env.DEPLOY_ID ? new URLSearchParams({ yourParam: process.env.DEPLOY_ID }) : undefined, }, }); }, }, }; } ``` ### `exports` [Section titled “exports”](#exports) **Type:** `string[]` Defines an array of named exports to use in conjunction with the [`createExports()` function](#createexports) of your server entrypoint. The following example assumes that `createExports()` provides an export named `handler`: my-adapter.mjs ```js export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ config, setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', exports: ['handler'] }); }, }, }; } ``` ### `previewEntrypoint` [Section titled “previewEntrypoint”](#previewentrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` **Added in:** `astro@1.5.0` Defines the path or ID of a module in the adapter’s package that is responsible for starting up the built server when `astro preview` is run. my-adapter.mjs ```js export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ config, setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', previewEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/preview.js', }); }, }, }; } ``` ## Building a server entrypoint [Section titled “Building a server entrypoint”](#building-a-server-entrypoint) You will need to create a file that executes during server-side requests to enable on-demand rendering with your particular host. Astro’s adapter API attempts to work with any type of host and gives a flexible way to conform to the host APIs. ### `createExports()` [Section titled “createExports()”](#createexports) **Type:** `(manifest: SSRManifest, options: any) => Record<string, any>` An exported function that takes an SSR manifest as its first argument and an object containing your adapter [`args`](#args) as its second argument. This should provide the exports required by your host. For example, some serverless hosts expect you to export an `handler()` function. With the adapter API, you achieve this by implementing `createExports()` in your server entrypoint: my-adapter/server.js ```js import { App } from 'astro/app'; export function createExports(manifest) { const app = new App(manifest); const handler = (event, context) => { // ... }; return { handler }; } ``` And then in your integration, where you call `setAdapter()`, provide this name in [`exports`](#exports): my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + exports: ['handler'], }); }, }, }; } ``` You can access the [`args`](#args) defined by your adapter through the second argument of `createExports()`. This can be useful when you need to access build-time configuration in your server entrypoint. For example, your server might need to identify where assets generated by Astro are located: my-adapter/server.js ```js import { App } from 'astro/app'; export function createExports(manifest, args) { const assetsPath = args.assets; const handler = (event, context) => { // ... }; return { handler }; } ``` ### `start()` [Section titled “start()”](#start) **Type:** `(manifest: SSRManifest, options: any) => Record<string, any>` An exported function that takes an SSR manifest as its first argument and an object containing your adapter [`args`](#args) as its second argument. Some hosts expect you to *start* the server yourselves, for example, by listening to a port. For these types of hosts, the adapter API allows you to export a `start()` function, which will be called when the bundle script is run. my-adapter/server.js ```js import { App } from 'astro/app'; export function start(manifest) { const app = new App(manifest); addEventListener('fetch', event => { // ... }); } ``` ### `astro/app` [Section titled “astro/app”](#astroapp) This module is used for rendering pages that have been prebuilt through `astro build`. Astro uses the standard [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects. Hosts that have a different API for request/response should convert to these types in their adapter. The `App` constructor accepts a required SSR manifest argument, and optionally an argument to enable or disable streaming, defaulting to `true`. ```js import { App } from 'astro/app'; import http from 'http'; export function start(manifest) { const app = new App(manifest); addEventListener('fetch', event => { event.respondWith( app.render(event.request) ); }); } ``` The following methods are provided: #### `app.render()` [Section titled “app.render()”](#apprender) **Type:** `(request: Request, options?: RenderOptions) => Promise<Response>` A method that accepts a required `request` argument and an optional `RenderOptions` object. This calls the Astro page that matches the request, renders it, and returns a promise to a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object. This also works for API routes that do not render pages. ```js const response = await app.render(request); ``` ##### `RenderOptions` [Section titled “RenderOptions”](#renderoptions) **Type:** `{addCookieHeader?: boolean; clientAddress?: string; locals?: object; prerenderedErrorPageFetch?: (url: ErrorPagePath) => Promise<Response>; routeData?: RouteData;}` An object that controls the rendering and contains the following properties: ###### `addCookieHeader` [Section titled “addCookieHeader”](#addcookieheader) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` Whether or not to automatically add all cookies written by `Astro.cookie.set()` to the response headers. When set to `true`, they will be added to the `Set-Cookie` header of the response as comma-separated key-value pairs. You can use the standard `response.headers.getSetCookie()` API to read them individually. When set to `false`(default), the cookies will only be available from [`App.getSetCookieFromResponse(response)`](#appgetsetcookiefromresponse). ```js const response = await app.render(request, { addCookieHeader: true }); ``` ###### `clientAddress` [Section titled “clientAddress”](#clientaddress) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `request[Symbol.for("astro.clientAddress")]` The client IP address that will be made available as [`Astro.clientAddress`](/en/reference/api-reference/#clientaddress) in pages, and as `ctx.clientAddress` in API routes and middleware. The example below reads the `x-forwarded-for` header and passes it as `clientAddress`. This value becomes available to the user as `Astro.clientAddress`. ```js const clientAddress = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for"); const response = await app.render(request, { clientAddress }); ``` ###### `locals` [Section titled “locals”](#locals) **Type:** `object` The [`context.locals` object](/en/reference/api-reference/#locals) used to store and access information during the lifecycle of a request. The example below reads a header named `x-private-header`, attempts to parse it as an object and pass it to `locals`, which can then be passed to any [middleware function](/en/guides/middleware/). ```js const privateHeader = request.headers.get("x-private-header"); let locals = {}; try { if (privateHeader) { locals = JSON.parse(privateHeader); } } finally { const response = await app.render(request, { locals }); } ``` ###### `prerenderedErrorPageFetch()` [Section titled “prerenderedErrorPageFetch()”](#prerenderederrorpagefetch) **Type:** `(url: ErrorPagePath) => Promise<Response>`\ **Default:** `fetch` **Added in:** `astro@5.6.0` A function that allows you to provide custom implementations for fetching prerendered error pages. This is used to override the default `fetch()` behavior, for example, when `fetch()` is unavailable or when you cannot call the server from itself. The following example reads `500.html` and `404.html` from disk instead of performing an HTTP call: ```ts return app.render(request, { prerenderedErrorPageFetch: async (url: string): Promise<Response> => { if (url.includes("/500")) { const content = await fs.promises.readFile("500.html", "utf-8"); return new Response(content, { status: 500, headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" }, }); } const content = await fs.promises.readFile("404.html", "utf-8"); return new Response(content, { status: 404, headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" }, }); } }); ``` If not provided, Astro will fallback to its default behavior for fetching error pages. ###### `routeData` [Section titled “routeData”](#routedata) **Type:** [`RouteData`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#routedata)\ **Default:** `app.match(request)` Defines the information about a route. This is useful when you already know the route to render. Doing so will bypass the internal call to [`app.match()`](#appmatch) to determine the route to render. ```js const routeData = app.match(request); if (routeData) { return app.render(request, { routeData }); } else { /* adapter-specific 404 response */ return new Response(..., { status: 404 }); } ``` #### `app.match()` [Section titled “app.match()”](#appmatch) **Type:** `(request: Request, allowPrerenderedRoutes = false) => RouteData | undefined` Determines if a request is matched by the Astro app’s routing rules. ```js if(app.match(request)) { const response = await app.render(request); } ``` You can usually call `app.render(request)` without using `.match` because Astro handles 404s if you provide a `404.astro` file. Use `app.match(request)` if you want to handle 404s in a different way. By default, prerendered routes aren’t returned, even if they are matched. You can change this behavior by using `true` as the second argument. #### `app.getAdapterLogger()` [Section titled “app.getAdapterLogger()”](#appgetadapterlogger) **Type:** `() => AstroIntegrationLogger` **Added in:** `astro@v3.0.0` Returns an [instance of the Astro logger](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astrointegrationlogger) available to the adapter’s runtime environment. ```js const logger = app.getAdapterLogger(); try { /* Some logic that can throw */ } catch { logger.error("Your custom error message using Astro logger."); } ``` #### `app.getAllowedDomains()` [Section titled “app.getAllowedDomains()”](#appgetalloweddomains) **Type:** `() => Partial<RemotePattern>[] | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.14.2` Returns a list of permitted host patterns for incoming requests when using on-demand rendering [as defined in the user configuration](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#securityalloweddomains). #### `app.removeBase()` [Section titled “app.removeBase()”](#appremovebase) **Type:** `(pathname: string) => string` **Added in:** `astro@1.6.4` Removes the base from the given path. This is useful when you need to look up assets from the filesystem. #### `app.setCookieHeaders()` [Section titled “app.setCookieHeaders()”](#appsetcookieheaders) **Type:** `(response: Response) => Generator<string, string[], any>` **Added in:** `astro@1.4.0` Returns a generator that yields individual cookie header values from a `Response` object. This is used to properly handle multiple cookies that may have been set during request processing. The following example appends a `Set-Cookie` header for each header obtained from a response: ```js for (const setCookieHeader of app.setCookieHeaders(response)) { response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', setCookieHeader); } ``` #### `App.getSetCookieFromResponse()` [Section titled “App.getSetCookieFromResponse()”](#appgetsetcookiefromresponse) **Type:** `(response: Response) => Generator<string, string[]>` **Added in:** `astro@4.2.0` Returns a generator that yields individual cookie header values from a `Response` object. This works in the same way as [`app.setCookieHeaders()`](#appsetcookieheaders), but can be used at any time as it is a static method. The following example appends a `Set-Cookie` header for each header obtained from a response: ```js for (const cookie of App.getSetCookieFromResponse(response)) { response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', cookie); } ``` #### `App.validateForwardedHost()` [Section titled “App.validateForwardedHost()”](#appvalidateforwardedhost) **Type:** `(forwardedHost: string, allowedDomains?: Partial<RemotePattern>[], protocol?: string = 'https') => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@5.14.2` Checks whether a `forwardedHost` matches any of the given [`allowedDomains`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#securityalloweddomains). This static method accepts a third argument that allows you to override the host protocol, defaulting to `https`. The following example retrieves the `forwardedHost` from the headers and checks if the host matches an allowed domain: ```js export function start(manifest) { addEventListener('fetch', (event) => { const forwardedHost = event.request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Host'); if (App.validateForwardedHost(forwardedHost, manifest.allowedDomains)) { /* do something */ } }); } ``` #### `App.sanitizeHost()` [Section titled “App.sanitizeHost()”](#appsanitizehost) **Type:** `(hostname: string | undefined) => string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.15.5` Validates a hostname by rejecting any name containing path separators. When a hostname is invalid, this static method will return `undefined`. The following example retrieves the `forwardedHost` from the headers and sanitizes it: ```js export function start(manifest) { addEventListener('fetch', (event) => { const forwardedHost = event.request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Host'); const sanitized = App.sanitizeHost(forwardedHost); }); } ``` #### `App.validateForwardedHeaders()` [Section titled “App.validateForwardedHeaders()”](#appvalidateforwardedheaders) **Type:** `(forwardedProtocol?: string, forwardedHost?: string, forwardedPort?: string, allowedDomains?: Partial<RemotePattern>[]) => { protocol?: string; host?: string; port?: string }` **Added in:** `astro@5.15.5` Validates the forwarded protocol, host, and port against the `allowedDomains`. This static method returns validated values or `undefined` for rejected headers. The following example validates the forwarded headers against the authorized domains defined in the received manifest: ```js export function start(manifest) { addEventListener('fetch', (event) => { const validated = App.validateForwardedHeaders( request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto') ?? undefined, request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Host') ?? undefined, request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Port') ?? undefined, manifest.allowedDomains, ); }); } ``` ### `astro/app/node` [Section titled “astro/app/node”](#astroappnode) Just like [`astro/app`](#astroapp), this module is used for rendering pages that have been prebuilt through `astro build`. This allows you to create a `NodeApp` providing all the methods available from `App` and additional methods useful for Node environments. The `NodeApp` constructor accepts a required SSR manifest argument, and optionally an argument to enable or disable streaming, defaulting to `true`. ```js import { NodeApp } from 'astro/app/node'; import http from 'http'; export function start(manifest) { const nodeApp = new NodeApp(manifest); addEventListener('fetch', event => { event.respondWith( nodeApp.render(event.request) ); }); } ``` The following additional methods are provided: #### `nodeApp.render()` [Section titled “nodeApp.render()”](#nodeapprender) **Type:** `(request: NodeRequest | Request, options?: RenderOptions) => Promise<Response>` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Extends [`app.render()`](#apprender) to also accept [Node.js `IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage) objects in addition to standard `Request` objects as the first argument. The second argument is an optional object allowing you to [control the rendering](#renderoptions). ```js const response = await nodeApp.render(request); ``` #### `nodeApp.match()` [Section titled “nodeApp.match()”](#nodeappmatch) **Type:** `(req: NodeRequest | Request, allowPrerenderedRoutes?: boolean) => RouteData | undefined` Extends [`app.match()`](#appmatch) to also accept [Node.js `IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage) objects in addition to standard `Request` objects. ```js if(nodeApp.match(request)) { const response = await nodeApp.render(request); } ``` #### `nodeApp.headersMap` [Section titled “nodeApp.headersMap”](#nodeappheadersmap) **Type:** `NodeAppHeadersJson | undefined`\ **Default:** `undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.11.0` An array containing the headers configuration. Each entry maps a pathname to a list of headers that should be applied for that route. This is useful for applying headers such as CSP directives to prerendered routes. #### `nodeApp.setHeadersMap()` [Section titled “nodeApp.setHeadersMap()”](#nodeappsetheadersmap) **Type:** `(headers: NodeAppHeadersJson) => void` **Added in:** `astro@5.11.0` Loads [headers configuration](#nodeappheadersmap) into the `NodeApp` instance. ```js nodeApp.setHeadersMap([ { pathname: "/blog", headers: [ { key: "Content-Security-Policy", value: "default-src 'self'" }, ] } ]); ``` #### `NodeApp.createRequest()` [Section titled “NodeApp.createRequest()”](#nodeappcreaterequest) **Type:** `(req: NodeRequest, options?: { skipBody?: boolean; allowedDomains?: Partial<RemotePattern>[]; }) => Request` **Added in:** `astro@4.2.0` Converts a NodeJS `IncomingMessage` into a standard `Request` object. This static method accepts an optional object as the second argument, allowing you to define if the body should be ignored, defaulting to `false`, and the [`allowedDomains`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#securityalloweddomains). The following example creates a `Request` and passes it to `app.render()`: ```js import { NodeApp } from 'astro/app/node'; import { createServer } from 'node:http'; const server = createServer(async (req, res) => { const request = NodeApp.createRequest(req); const response = await app.render(request); }) ``` #### `NodeApp.writeResponse()` [Section titled “NodeApp.writeResponse()”](#nodeappwriteresponse) **Type:** `(source: Response, destination: ServerResponse) => Promise<ServerResponse<IncomingMessage> | undefined>` **Added in:** `astro@4.2.0` Streams a web-standard `Response` into a NodeJS server response. This static method takes a `Response` object and the initial `ServerResponse` before returning a promise of a `ServerResponse` object. The following example creates a `Request`, passes it to `app.render()`, and writes the response: ```js import { NodeApp } from 'astro/app/node'; import { createServer } from 'node:http'; const server = createServer(async (req, res) => { const request = NodeApp.createRequest(req); const response = await app.render(request); await NodeApp.writeResponse(response, res); }) ``` ## Astro features [Section titled “Astro features”](#astro-features) Astro features are a way for an adapter to tell Astro whether they are able to support a feature, and also the adapter’s level of support. When using these properties, Astro will: * run specific validation; * emit contextual information to the logs; These operations are run based on the features supported or not supported, their level of support, the [desired amount of logging](#suppress), and the user’s own configuration. The following configuration tells Astro that this adapter has experimental support for the Sharp-powered built-in image service: my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + supportedAstroFeatures: { + sharpImageService: 'experimental' + } }); }, }, }; } ``` If the Sharp image service is used, Astro will log a warning and error to the terminal based on your adapter’s support: ```plaintext [@example/my-adapter] The feature is experimental and subject to issues or changes. [@example/my-adapter] The currently selected adapter `@example/my-adapter` is not compatible with the service "Sharp". Your project will NOT be able to build. ``` A message can additionally be provided to give more context to the user: my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + supportedAstroFeatures: { + sharpImageService: { + support: 'limited', + message: 'This adapter has limited support for Sharp. Certain features may not work as expected.' + } + } }); }, }, }; } ``` This object contains the following configurable features: ### `staticOutput` [Section titled “staticOutput”](#staticoutput) **Type:** [`AdapterSupport`](#adaptersupport) Defines whether the adapter is able to serve static pages. ### `hybridOutput` [Section titled “hybridOutput”](#hybridoutput) **Type:** [`AdapterSupport`](#adaptersupport) Defines whether the adapter is able to serve sites that include a mix of static and on-demand rendered pages. ### `serverOutput` [Section titled “serverOutput”](#serveroutput) **Type:** [`AdapterSupport`](#adaptersupport) Defines whether the adapter is able to serve on-demand rendered pages. ### `i18nDomains` [Section titled “i18nDomains”](#i18ndomains) **Type:** [`AdapterSupport`](#adaptersupport) **Added in:** `astro@4.3.0` Defines whether the adapter is able to support i18n domains. ### `envGetSecret` [Section titled “envGetSecret”](#envgetsecret) **Type:** [`AdapterSupport`](#adaptersupport) **Added in:** `astro@4.10.0` Defines whether the adapter is able to support `getSecret()` exported from [`astro:env/server`](/en/reference/modules/astro-env/). When enabled, this feature allows your adapter to retrieve secrets configured by users in `env.schema`. The following example enables the feature by passing [a valid `AdapterSupportsKind` value](#adaptersupportskind) to the adapter: my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + supportedAstroFeatures: { + envGetSecret: 'stable' + } }); }, }, }; } ``` The `astro/env/setup` module allows you to provide an implementation for `getSecret()`. In [your server entrypoint](#building-a-server-entrypoint), call `setGetEnv()` as soon as possible: ```diff import { App } from 'astro/app'; +import { setGetEnv } from "astro/env/setup" +setGetEnv((key) => process.env[key]) export function createExports(manifest) { const app = new App(manifest); const handler = (event, context) => { // ... }; return { handler }; } ``` If the adapter supports secrets, be sure to call `setGetEnv()` before `getSecret()` when environment variables are tied to the request: ```diff import type { SSRManifest } from 'astro'; import { App } from 'astro/app'; +import { setGetEnv } from 'astro/env/setup'; import { createGetEnv } from '../utils/env.js'; type Env = { [key: string]: unknown; }; export function createExports(manifest: SSRManifest) { const app = new App(manifest); const fetch = async (request: Request, env: Env) => { +setGetEnv(createGetEnv(env)); const response = await app.render(request); return response; }; return { default: { fetch } }; } ``` ### `sharpImageService` [Section titled “sharpImageService”](#sharpimageservice) **Type:** [`AdapterSupport`](#adaptersupport) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Defines whether the adapter supports image transformation using the built-in Sharp image service. ## Adapter features [Section titled “Adapter features”](#adapter-features) A set of features that changes the output of the emitted files. When an adapter opts in to these features, they will get additional information inside specific hooks and must implement the proper logic to handle the different output. ### `edgeMiddleware` [Section titled “edgeMiddleware”](#edgemiddleware) **Type:** `boolean` Defines whether any on-demand rendering middleware code will be bundled when built. When enabled, this prevents middleware code from being bundled and imported by all pages during the build: my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + adapterFeatures: { + edgeMiddleware: true + } }); }, }, }; } ``` Then, consume the hook [`astro:build:ssr`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astrobuildssr), which will give you a `middlewareEntryPoint`, an `URL` to the physical file on the file system. my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', adapterFeatures: { edgeMiddleware: true } }); }, +'astro:build:ssr': ({ middlewareEntryPoint }) => { +// remember to check if this property exits, it will be `undefined` if the adapter doesn't opt in to the feature +if (middlewareEntryPoint) { +createEdgeMiddleware(middlewareEntryPoint) + } + } }, }; } function createEdgeMiddleware(middlewareEntryPoint) { // emit a new physical file using your bundler } ``` ### `buildOutput` [Section titled “buildOutput”](#buildoutput) **Type:** `"static" | "server"`\ **Default:** `"server"` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Allows you to force a specific output shape for the build. This can be useful for adapters that only work with a specific output type. For example, your adapter might expect a static website, but uses an adapter to create host-specific files. Defaults to `server` if not specified. my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + adapterFeatures: { + buildOutput: 'static' + } }); }, }, }; } ``` ### `experimentalStaticHeaders` [Section titled “experimentalStaticHeaders”](#experimentalstaticheaders) **Type:** `boolean` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.3` Whether or not the adapter provides experimental support for setting response headers for static pages. When this feature is enabled, Astro will return a map of the `Headers` emitted by the static pages. This map `experimentalRouteToHeaders` is available in the [`astro:build:generated` hook](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astrobuildgenerated) for generating files such as a `_headers` that allows you to make changes to the default HTTP header. my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', + adapterFeatures: { + experimentalStaticHeaders: true, + }, }); }, 'astro:build:generated': ({ experimentalRouteToHeaders }) => { // use `experimentalRouteToHeaders` to generate a configuration file // for your virtual host of choice }, }, }; } ``` The value of the headers might change based on the features enabled/used by the application. For example, if [CSP is enabled](/en/reference/experimental-flags/csp/), the `<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy">` element is not added to the static page. Instead, its `content` is available in the `experimentalRouteToHeaders` map. ## Adapter types reference [Section titled “Adapter types reference”](#adapter-types-reference) ### `AdapterSupport` [Section titled “AdapterSupport”](#adaptersupport) **Type:** `AdapterSupportsKind | AdapterSupportWithMessage` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A union of valid formats to describe the support level for a feature. ### `AdapterSupportsKind` [Section titled “AdapterSupportsKind”](#adaptersupportskind) **Type:** `"deprecated" | "experimental" | "limited" | "stable" | "unsupported"` Defines the level of support for a feature by your adapter: * Use `"deprecated"` when your adapter deprecates support for a feature before removing it completely in a future version. * Use `"experimental"` when your adapter adds support for a feature, but issues or breaking changes are expected. * Use `"limited"` when your adapter only supports a subset of the full feature. * Use `"stable"` when the feature is fully supported by your adapter. * Use `"unsupported"` to warn users that they may encounter build issues in their project, as this feature is not supported by your adapter. ### `AdapterSupportWithMessage` [Section titled “AdapterSupportWithMessage”](#adaptersupportwithmessage) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` An object that allows you to define a support level for a feature and a message to be logged in the user console. This object contains the following properties: #### `support` [Section titled “support”](#support) **Type:** `Exclude<AdapterSupportsKind, “stable”>` Defines the level of support for a feature by your adapter. #### `message` [Section titled “message”](#message) **Type:** `string` Defines a custom message to log regarding the support of a feature by your adapter. #### `suppress` [Section titled “suppress”](#suppress) **Type:** `"default" | "all"` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` An option to prevent showing some or all logged messages about an adapter’s support for a feature. If Astro’s default log message is redundant, or confusing to the user in combination with your [custom `message`](#message), you can use `suppress: "default"` to suppress the default message and only log your message: my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', supportedAstroFeatures: { sharpImageService: { support: 'limited', message: 'The adapter has limited support for Sharp. It will be used for images during build time, but will not work at runtime.', + suppress: 'default' // custom message is more detailed than the default } } }); }, }, }; } ``` You can also use `suppress: "all"` to suppress all messages about support for the feature. This is useful when these messages are unhelpful to users in a specific context, such as when they have a configuration setting that means they are not using that feature. For example, you can choose to prevent logging any messages about Sharp support from your adapter: my-adapter.mjs ```diff export default function createIntegration() { return { name: '@example/my-adapter', hooks: { 'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => { setAdapter({ name: '@example/my-adapter', serverEntrypoint: '@example/my-adapter/server.js', supportedAstroFeatures: { sharpImageService: { support: 'limited', message: 'This adapter has limited support for Sharp. Certain features may not work as expected.', + suppress: 'all' } } }); }, }, }; } ``` ## Allow installation via `astro add` [Section titled “Allow installation via astro add”](#allow-installation-via-astro-add) [The `astro add` command](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-add) allows users to easily add integrations and adapters to their project. To allow your adapter to be installed with this command, **add `astro-adapter` to the `keywords` field in your `package.json`**: ```json { "name": "example", "keywords": ["astro-adapter"], } ``` Once you [publish your adapter to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish), running `astro add example` will install your package with any peer dependencies specified in your `package.json` and instruct users to update their project config manually.

# Astro render context

When rendering a page, Astro provides a runtime API specific to the current render. This includes useful information such as the current page URL as well as APIs to perform actions like redirecting to another page. In `.astro` components, this context is available from the `Astro` global object. Endpoint functions are also called with this same context object as their first argument, whose properties mirror the Astro global properties. Some properties are only available for routes rendered on demand or may have limited functionality on prerendered pages. The `Astro` global object is available to all `.astro` files. Use the `context` object in [endpoint functions](/en/guides/endpoints/) to serve static or live server endpoints and in [middleware](/en/guides/middleware/) to inject behavior when a page or endpoint is about to be rendered. ## The context object [Section titled “The context object”](#the-context-object) The following properties are available on the `Astro` global (e.g. `Astro.props`, `Astro.redirect()`) and are also available on the context object (e.g. `context.props`, `context.redirect()`) passed to endpoint functions and middleware. ### `props` [Section titled “props”](#props) `props` is an object containing any values that have been passed as [component attributes](/en/basics/astro-components/#component-props). src/components/Heading.astro ```astro --- const { title, date } = Astro.props; --- <div> <h1>{title}</h1> <p>{date}</p> </div> ``` src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Heading from '../components/Heading.astro'; --- <Heading title="My First Post" date="09 Aug 2022" /> ``` Learn more about how [Markdown and MDX layouts](/en/guides/markdown-content/#frontmatter-layout-property) handle props. The `props` object also contains any `props` passed from `getStaticPaths()` when rendering static routes. * Astro.props src/pages/posts/\[id].astro ```astro --- export function getStaticPaths() { return [ { params: { id: '1' }, props: { author: 'Blu' } }, { params: { id: '2' }, props: { author: 'Erika' } }, { params: { id: '3' }, props: { author: 'Matthew' } } ]; } const { id } = Astro.params; const { author } = Astro.props; --- ``` * context.props src/pages/posts/\[id].json.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function getStaticPaths() { return [ { params: { id: '1' }, props: { author: 'Blu' } }, { params: { id: '2' }, props: { author: 'Erika' } }, { params: { id: '3' }, props: { author: 'Matthew' } } ]; } export function GET({ props }: APIContext) { return new Response( JSON.stringify({ author: props.author }), ); } ``` See also: [Data Passing with `props`](/en/reference/routing-reference/#data-passing-with-props) ### `params` [Section titled “params”](#params) `params` is an object containing the values of dynamic route segments matched for a request. Its keys must match the [parameters](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) in the page or endpoint file path. In static builds, this will be the `params` returned by `getStaticPaths()` used for prerendering [dynamic routes](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes): * Astro.params src/pages/posts/\[id].astro ```astro --- export function getStaticPaths() { return [ { params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }, { params: { id: '3' } } ]; } const { id } = Astro.params; --- <h1>{id}</h1> ``` * context.params src/pages/posts/\[id].json.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function getStaticPaths() { return [ { params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }, { params: { id: '3' } } ]; } export function GET({ params }: APIContext) { return new Response( JSON.stringify({ id: params.id }), ); } ``` When routes are rendered on demand, `params` can be any value matching the path segments in the dynamic route pattern. src/pages/posts/\[id].astro ```astro --- import { getPost } from '../api'; const post = await getPost(Astro.params.id); // No posts found with this ID if (!post) { return Astro.redirect("/404") } --- <html> <h1>{post.name}</h1> </html> ``` See also: [`params`](/en/reference/routing-reference/#params) ### `url` [Section titled “url”](#url) **Type:** `URL` **Added in:** `astro@1.0.0` `url` is a [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) object constructed from the current `request.url` value. It is useful for interacting with individual properties of the request URL, like pathname and origin. `Astro.url` is equivalent to doing `new URL(Astro.request.url)`. `url` will be a `localhost` URL in dev mode. When building a site, prerendered routes will receive a URL based on the [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) and [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) options. If `site` is not configured, prerendered pages will receive a `localhost` URL during builds as well. src/pages/index.astro ```astro <h1>The current URL is: {Astro.url}</h1> <h1>The current URL pathname is: {Astro.url.pathname}</h1> <h1>The current URL origin is: {Astro.url.origin}</h1> ``` You can also use `url` to create new URLs by passing it as an argument to [`new URL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL). src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- // Example: Construct a canonical URL using your production domain const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site); // Example: Construct a URL for SEO meta tags using your current domain const socialImageURL = new URL('/images/preview.png', Astro.url); --- <link rel="canonical" href={canonicalURL} /> <meta property="og:image" content={socialImageURL} /> ``` ### `site` [Section titled “site”](#site) **Type:** `URL | undefined` `site` returns a `URL` made from `site` in your Astro config. It returns `undefined` if you have not set a value for [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) in your Astro config. src/pages/index.astro ```astro <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Your Site's Title" href={new URL("rss.xml", Astro.site)} /> ``` ### `clientAddress` [Section titled “clientAddress”](#clientaddress) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@1.0.0` `clientAddress` specifies the [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of the request. This property is only available for routes rendered on demand and cannot be used on prerendered pages. * Astro.clientAddress src/pages/ip-address.astro ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode --- <div>Your IP address is: <span class="address">{Astro.clientAddress}</span></div> ``` * context.clientAddress src/pages/ip-address.ts ```ts export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ clientAddress }: APIContext) { return new Response(`Your IP address is: ${clientAddress}`); } ``` ### `isPrerendered` [Section titled “isPrerendered”](#isprerendered) **Type**: `boolean` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A boolean representing whether or not the current page is prerendered. You can use this property to run conditional logic in middleware, for example, to avoid accessing headers in prerendered pages. ### `generator` [Section titled “generator”](#generator) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@1.0.0` `generator` provides the current version of Astro your project is running. This is a convenient way to add a [`<meta name="generator">`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#meta-generator) tag with your current version of Astro. It follows the format `"Astro v5.x.x"`. * Astro.generator src/pages/site-info.astro ```astro <html> <head> <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} /> </head> <body> <footer> <p>Built with <a href="https://astro.build">{Astro.generator}</a></p> </footer> </body> </html> ``` * context.generator src/pages/site-info.json.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ generator, site }: APIContext) { const body = JSON.stringify({ generator, site }); return new Response(body); } ``` ### `request` [Section titled “request”](#request) **Type:** `Request` `request` is a standard [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object. It can be used to get the `url`, `headers`, `method`, and even the body of the request. * Astro.request src/pages/index.astro ```astro <p>Received a {Astro.request.method} request to "{Astro.request.url}".</p> <p>Received request headers:</p> <p><code>{JSON.stringify(Object.fromEntries(Astro.request.headers))}</code></p> ``` * context.request ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ request }: APIContext) { return new Response(`Hello ${request.url}`); } ``` ### `response` [Section titled “response”](#response) **Type:** `ResponseInit & { readonly headers: Headers }` `response` is a standard `ResponseInit` object. It has the following structure. * `status`: The numeric status code of the response, e.g., `200`. * `statusText`: The status message associated with the status code, e.g., `'OK'`. * `headers`: A [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) instance that you can use to set the HTTP headers of the response. `Astro.response` is used to set the `status`, `statusText`, and `headers` for a page’s response. ```astro --- if (condition) { Astro.response.status = 404; Astro.response.statusText = 'Not found'; } --- ``` Or to set a header: ```astro --- Astro.response.headers.set('Set-Cookie', 'a=b; Path=/;'); --- ``` ### `redirect()` [Section titled “redirect()”](#redirect) **Type:** `(path: string, status?: number) => Response` **Added in:** `astro@1.5.0` `redirect()` returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object that allows you to redirect to another page, and optionally provide an [HTTP response status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) as a second parameter. A page (and not a child component) must `return` the result of `Astro.redirect()` for the redirect to occur. For statically-generated routes, this will produce a client redirect using a [`<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#http-equiv) and does not support status codes. For on-demand rendered routes, setting a custom status code is supported when redirecting. If not specified, redirects will be served with a `302` status code. The following example redirects a user to a login page: * Astro.redirect() src/pages/account.astro ```astro --- import { isLoggedIn } from '../utils'; const cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie'); // If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page if (!isLoggedIn(cookie)) { return Astro.redirect('/login'); } --- <p>User information</p> ``` * context.redirect() ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ redirect, request }: APIContext) { const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie'); if (!isLoggedIn(cookie)) { return redirect('/login', 302); } else { // return user information } } ``` ### `rewrite()` [Section titled “rewrite()”](#rewrite) **Type:** `(rewritePayload: string | URL | Request) => Promise<Response>` **Added in:** `astro@4.13.0` `rewrite()` allows you to serve content from a different URL or path without redirecting the browser to a new page. The method accepts either a string, a `URL`, or a `Request` for the location of the path. Use a string to provide an explicit path: * Astro.rewrite() src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- return Astro.rewrite("/login") --- ``` * context.rewrite() ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ rewrite }: APIContext) { return rewrite('/login'); } ``` Use a `URL` type when you need to construct the URL path for the rewrite. The following example renders a page’s parent path by creating a new URL from the relative `"../"` path: * Astro.rewrite() src/pages/blog/index.astro ```astro --- return Astro.rewrite(new URL("../", Astro.url)) --- ``` * context.rewrite() ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ rewrite }: APIContext) { return rewrite(new URL("../", Astro.url)); } ``` Use a `Request` type for complete control of the `Request` sent to the server for the new path. The following example sends a request to render the parent page while also providing headers: * Astro.rewrite() src/pages/blog/index.astro ```astro --- return Astro.rewrite(new Request(new URL("../", Astro.url), { headers: { "x-custom-header": JSON.stringify(Astro.locals.someValue) } })) --- ``` * context.rewrite() ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ rewrite }: APIContext) { return rewrite(new Request(new URL("../", Astro.url), { headers: { "x-custom-header": JSON.stringify(Astro.locals.someValue) } })); } ``` ### `originPathname` [Section titled “originPathname”](#originpathname) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` `originPathname` defines the original pathname of the request, before rewrites were applied. * Astro.originPathname src/pages/404.astro ```astro <p>The origin path is {Astro.originPathname}</p> <p>The rewritten path is {Astro.url.pathname}</p> ``` * context.originPathname src/middleware.ts ```ts import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { // Record the original pathname before any rewrites recordPageVisit(context.originPathname); return next(); }); ``` ### `locals` [Section titled “locals”](#locals) **Added in:** `astro@2.4.0` `locals` is an object used to store and access arbitrary information during the lifecycle of a request. `Astro.locals` is an object containing any values from the `context.locals` object set by middleware. Use this to access data returned by middleware in your `.astro` files. Middleware functions can both read and write the values of `context.locals`: src/middleware.ts ```ts import type { MiddlewareHandler } from 'astro'; export const onRequest: MiddlewareHandler = ({ locals }, next) => { if (!locals.title) { locals.title = "Default Title"; } return next(); } ``` Astro components and API endpoints can read values from `locals` when they render: * Astro.locals src/pages/Orders.astro ```astro --- const title = Astro.locals.title; --- <h1>{title}</h1> ``` * context.locals src/pages/hello.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export function GET({ locals }: APIContext) { return new Response(locals.title); // "Default Title" } ``` ### `preferredLocale` [Section titled “preferredLocale”](#preferredlocale) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` `preferredLocale` is a computed value to find the best match between your visitor’s browser language preferences and the locales supported by your site. It is computed by checking the configured locales in your [`i18n.locales`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18nlocales) array and the locales supported by the user’s browser via the header `Accept-Language`. This value is `undefined` if no such match exists. This property is only available for routes rendered on demand and cannot be used on prerendered, static pages. ### `preferredLocaleList` [Section titled “preferredLocaleList”](#preferredlocalelist) **Type:** `string[] | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` `preferredLocaleList` represents the array of all locales that are both requested by the browser and supported by your website. This produces a list of all compatible languages between your site and your visitor. If none of the browser’s requested languages are found in your locales array, then the value is `[]`. This occurs when you do not support any of your visitor’s preferred locales. If the browser does not specify any preferred languages, then this value will be [`i18n.locales`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18nlocales): all of your supported locales will be considered equally preferred by a visitor with no preferences. This property is only available for routes rendered on demand and cannot be used on prerendered, static pages. ### `currentLocale` [Section titled “currentLocale”](#currentlocale) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.6` The locale computed from the current URL, using the syntax specified in your `locales` configuration. If the URL does not contain a `/[locale]/` prefix, then the value will default to [`i18n.defaultLocale`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18ndefaultlocale). ### `getActionResult()` [Section titled “getActionResult()”](#getactionresult) **Type:** `(action: TAction) => ActionReturnType<TAction> | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@4.15.0` `getActionResult()` is a function that returns the result of an [Action](/en/guides/actions/) submission. This accepts an action function as an argument (e.g. `actions.logout`) and returns a `data` or `error` object when a submission is received. Otherwise, it will return `undefined`. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { actions } from 'astro:actions'; const result = Astro.getActionResult(actions.logout); --- <form action={actions.logout}> <button type="submit">Log out</button> </form> {result?.error && <p>Failed to log out. Please try again.</p>} ``` ### `callAction()` [Section titled “callAction()”](#callaction) **Added in:** `astro@4.15.0` `callAction()` is a function used to call an Action handler directly from your Astro component. This function accepts an Action function as the first argument (e.g. `actions.logout`) and any input that action receives as the second argument. It returns the result of the action as a promise. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { actions } from 'astro:actions'; const { data, error } = await Astro.callAction(actions.logout, { userId: '123' }); --- ``` ### `routePattern` [Section titled “routePattern”](#routepattern) **Type**: `string` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The route pattern responsible for generating the current page or route. In file-based routing, this resembles the file path in your project used to create the route. When integrations create routes for your project, `context.routePattern` is identical to the value for `injectRoute.pattern`. The value will start with a leading slash and look similar to the path of a page component relative to your `src/pages/` folder without a file extension. For example, the file `src/pages/en/blog/[slug].astro` will return `/en/blog/[slug]` for `routePattern`. Every page on your site generated by that file (e.g. `/en/blog/post-1/`, `/en/blog/post-2/`, etc.) shares the same value for `routePattern`. In the case of `index.*` routes, the route pattern will not include the word “index.” For example, `src/pages/index.astro` will return `/`. You can use this property to understand which route is rendering your component. This allows you to target or analyze similarly-generated page URLs together. For example, you can use it to conditionally render certain information, or collect metrics about which routes are slower. ### `cookies` [Section titled “cookies”](#cookies) **Type:** `AstroCookies` **Added in:** `astro@1.4.0` `cookies` contains utilities for reading and manipulating cookies for [routes rendered on demand](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/). #### Cookie utilities [Section titled “Cookie utilities”](#cookie-utilities) ##### `cookies.get()` [Section titled “cookies.get()”](#cookiesget) **Type:** `(key: string, options?: AstroCookieGetOptions) => AstroCookie | undefined` Gets the cookie as an [`AstroCookie`](#astrocookie-type) object, which contains the `value` and utility functions for converting the cookie to non-string types. ##### `cookies.has()` [Section titled “cookies.has()”](#cookieshas) **Type:** `(key: string, options?: AstroCookieGetOptions) => boolean` Whether this cookie exists. If the cookie has been set via `Astro.cookies.set()` this will return true, otherwise, it will check cookies in the `Astro.request`. ##### `cookies.set()` [Section titled “cookies.set()”](#cookiesset) **Type:** `(key: string, value: string | object, options?: AstroCookieSetOptions) => void` Sets the cookie `key` to the given value. This will attempt to convert the cookie value to a string. Options provide ways to set [cookie features](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie#options-1), such as the `maxAge` or `httpOnly`. ##### `cookies.delete()` [Section titled “cookies.delete()”](#cookiesdelete) **Type:** `(key: string, options?: AstroCookieDeleteOptions) => void` Invalidates a cookie by setting the expiration date in the past (0 in Unix time). Once a cookie is “deleted” (expired), `Astro.cookies.has()` will return `false` and `Astro.cookies.get()` will return an [`AstroCookie`](#astrocookie-type) with a `value` of `undefined`. Options available when deleting a cookie are: `domain`, `path`, `httpOnly`, `sameSite`, and `secure`. ##### `cookies.merge()` [Section titled “cookies.merge()”](#cookiesmerge) **Type:** `(cookies: AstroCookies) => void` Merges a new `AstroCookies` instance into the current instance. Any new cookies will be added to the current instance and any cookies with the same name will overwrite existing values. ##### `cookies.headers()` [Section titled “cookies.headers()”](#cookiesheaders) **Type:** `() => Iterator<string>` Gets the header values for `Set-Cookie` that will be sent out with the response. #### `AstroCookie` Type [Section titled “AstroCookie Type”](#astrocookie-type) The type returned from getting a cookie via `Astro.cookies.get()`. It has the following properties: ##### `value` [Section titled “value”](#value) **Type:** `string` The raw string value of the cookie. ##### `json` [Section titled “json”](#json) **Type:** `() => Record<string, any>` Parses the cookie value via `JSON.parse()`, returning an object. Throws if the cookie value is not valid JSON. ##### `number` [Section titled “number”](#number) **Type:** `() => number` Parses the cookie value as a Number. Returns NaN if not a valid number. ##### `boolean` [Section titled “boolean”](#boolean) **Type:** `() => boolean` Converts the cookie value to a boolean. #### `AstroCookieGetOptions` [Section titled “AstroCookieGetOptions”](#astrocookiegetoptions) **Added in:** `astro@4.1.0` The `AstroCookieGetOption` interface allows you to specify options when you get a cookie. ##### `decode` [Section titled “decode”](#decode) **Type:** `(value: string) => string` Allows customization of how a cookie is deserialized into a value. #### `AstroCookieSetOptions` [Section titled “AstroCookieSetOptions”](#astrocookiesetoptions) **Added in:** `astro@4.1.0` `AstroCookieSetOptions` is an object that can be passed to `Astro.cookies.set()` when setting a cookie to customize how the cookie is serialized. ##### `domain` [Section titled “domain”](#domain) **Type:** `string` Specifies the domain. If no domain is set, most clients will interpret to apply to the current domain. ##### `expires` [Section titled “expires”](#expires) **Type:** `Date` Specifies the date on which the cookie will expire. ##### `httpOnly` [Section titled “httpOnly”](#httponly) **Type:** `boolean` If true, the cookie will not be accessible client-side. ##### `maxAge` [Section titled “maxAge”](#maxage) **Type:** `number` Specifies a number, in seconds, for which the cookie is valid. ##### `path` [Section titled “path”](#path) **Type:** `string` Specifies a subpath of the domain in which the cookie is applied. ##### `partitioned` [Section titled “partitioned”](#partitioned) **Type:** `boolean` **Added in:** `astro@5.17.0` New If true, the cookie is a [partitioned cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies). Partitioned cookies can only be read within the context of the top-level site on which they were set, which allows cross-site tracking to be blocked while still enabling legitimate uses of third-party cookies. Partitioned cookies must be set with `secure: true`. ##### `sameSite` [Section titled “sameSite”](#samesite) **Type:** `boolean | 'lax' | 'none' | 'strict'` Specifies the value of the [SameSite](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-09#section-5.4.7) cookie header. ##### `secure` [Section titled “secure”](#secure) **Type:** `boolean` If true, the cookie is only set on https sites. ##### `encode` [Section titled “encode”](#encode) **Type:** `(value: string) => string` Allows customizing how the cookie is serialized. ### `session` [Section titled “session”](#session) **Type:** `AstroSession` **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` `session` is an object that allows data to be stored between requests for [routes rendered on demand](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/). It is associated with a cookie that contains the session ID only: the data itself is not stored in the cookie. The session is created when first used, and the session cookie is automatically set. The `session` object is `undefined` if no session storage has been configured, or if the current route is prerendered, and will log an error if you try to use it. See [the session guide](/en/guides/sessions/) for more information on how to use sessions in your Astro project. #### `get()` [Section titled “get()”](#get) **Type**: `(key: string) => Promise<any>` Returns the value of the given key in the session. If the key does not exist, it returns `undefined`. * Astro.session src/components/Cart.astro ```astro --- const cart = await Astro.session?.get('cart'); --- <button>🛒 {cart?.length}</button> ``` * context.session src/pages/api/cart.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export async function GET({ session }: APIContext) { const cart = await session.get('cart'); return Response.json({ cart }); } ``` #### `set()` [Section titled “set()”](#set) **Type**: `(key: string, value: any, options?: { ttl: number }) => void` Sets the value of the given key in the session. The value can be any serializable type. This method is synchronous and the value is immediately available for retrieval, but it is not saved to the backend until the end of the request. * Astro.session src/pages/products/\[slug].astro ```astro --- const { slug } = Astro.params; Astro.session?.set('lastViewedProduct', slug); --- ``` * context.session src/pages/api/add-to-cart.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export async function POST({ session, request }: APIContext) { const cart = await session.get('cart'); const newItem = await request.json(); cart.push(newItem); // Save the updated cart to the session session.set('cart', cart); return Response.json({ cart }); } ``` #### `regenerate()` [Section titled “regenerate()”](#regenerate) **Type**: `() => void` Regenerates the session ID. Call this when a user logs in or escalates their privileges, to prevent session fixation attacks. * Astro.session src/pages/welcome.astro ```astro --- Astro.session?.regenerate(); --- ``` * context.session src/pages/api/login.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export async function POST({ session }: APIContext) { // Authenticate the user... doLogin(); // Regenerate the session ID to prevent session fixation attacks session.regenerate(); return Response.json({ success: true }); } ``` #### `destroy()` [Section titled “destroy()”](#destroy) **Type**: `() => void` Destroys the session, deleting the cookie and the object from the backend. Call this when a user logs out or their session is otherwise invalidated. * Astro.session src/pages/logout.astro ```astro --- Astro.session?.destroy(); return Astro.redirect('/login'); --- ``` * context.session src/pages/api/logout.ts ```ts import type { APIContext } from 'astro'; export async function POST({ session }: APIContext) { session.destroy(); return Response.json({ success: true }); } ``` #### `load()` [Section titled “load()”](#load) **Type**: `(id: string) => Promise<void>` Loads a session by ID. In normal use, a session is loaded automatically from the request cookie. Use this method to load a session from a different ID. This is useful if you are handling the session ID yourself, or if you want to keep track of a session without using cookies. * Astro.session src/pages/cart.astro ```astro --- // Load the session from a header instead of cookies const sessionId = Astro.request.headers.get('x-session-id'); await Astro.session?.load(sessionId); const cart = await Astro.session?.get('cart'); --- <h1>Your cart</h1> <ul> {cart?.map((item) => ( <li>{item.name}</li> ))} </ul> ``` * context.session src/pages/api/load-session.ts ```ts import type { APIRoute } from 'astro'; export const GET: APIRoute = async ({ session, request }) => { // Load the session from a header instead of cookies const sessionId = request.headers.get('x-session-id'); await session.load(sessionId); const cart = await session.get('cart'); return Response.json({ cart }); }; ``` ### Deprecated object properties [Section titled “Deprecated object properties”](#deprecated-object-properties) #### `Astro.glob()` [Section titled “Astro.glob()”](#astroglob) Deprecated in v5.0 Use [Vite’s `import.meta.glob`](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import) to query project files. `Astro.glob('../pages/post/*.md')` can be replaced with: `Object.values(import.meta.glob('../pages/post/*.md', { eager: true }));` See the [imports guide](/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob) for more information and usage. `Astro.glob()` is a way to load many local files into your static site setup. src/components/my-component.astro ```astro --- const posts = await Astro.glob('../pages/post/*.md'); // returns an array of posts that live at ./src/pages/post/*.md --- <div> {posts.slice(0, 3).map((post) => ( <article> <h2>{post.frontmatter.title}</h2> <p>{post.frontmatter.description}</p> <a href={post.url}>Read more</a> </article> ))} </div> ``` `.glob()` only takes one parameter: a relative URL glob of which local files you’d like to import. It’s asynchronous and returns an array of the exports from matching files. `.glob()` can’t take variables or strings that interpolate them, as they aren’t statically analyzable. (See [the imports guide](/en/guides/imports/#supported-values) for a workaround.) This is because `Astro.glob()` is a wrapper of Vite’s [`import.meta.glob()`](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import). ##### Markdown Files [Section titled “Markdown Files”](#markdown-files) Markdown files loaded with `Astro.glob()` return the following `MarkdownInstance` interface: ```ts export interface MarkdownInstance<T extends Record<string, any>> { /* Any data specified in this file's YAML/TOML frontmatter */ frontmatter: T; /* The absolute file path of this file */ file: string; /* The rendered path of this file */ url: string | undefined; /* Astro Component that renders the contents of this file */ Content: AstroComponentFactory; /** (Markdown only) Raw Markdown file content, excluding layout HTML and YAML/TOML frontmatter */ rawContent(): string; /** (Markdown only) Markdown file compiled to HTML, excluding layout HTML */ compiledContent(): string; /* Function that returns an array of the h1...h6 elements in this file */ getHeadings(): Promise<{ depth: number; slug: string; text: string }[]>; default: AstroComponentFactory; } ``` You can optionally provide a type for the `frontmatter` variable using a TypeScript generic. ```astro --- interface Frontmatter { title: string; description?: string; } const posts = await Astro.glob<Frontmatter>('../pages/post/*.md'); --- <ul> {posts.map(post => <li>{post.frontmatter.title}</li>)} </ul> ``` ##### Astro Files [Section titled “Astro Files”](#astro-files) Astro files have the following interface: ```ts export interface AstroInstance { /* The file path of this file */ file: string; /* The URL for this file (if it is in the pages directory) */ url: string | undefined; default: AstroComponentFactory; } ``` ##### Other Files [Section titled “Other Files”](#other-files) Other files may have various different interfaces, but `Astro.glob()` accepts a TypeScript generic if you know exactly what an unrecognized file type contains. ```ts --- interface CustomDataFile { default: Record<string, any>; } const data = await Astro.glob<CustomDataFile>('../data/**/*.js'); --- ```

# Template expressions reference

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. The syntax was designed to feel familiar to anyone with experience writing HTML or JSX, and adds support for including components and JavaScript expressions. ## JSX-like Expressions [Section titled “JSX-like Expressions”](#jsx-like-expressions) You can define local JavaScript variables inside of the frontmatter component script between the two code fences (`---`) of an Astro component. You can then inject these variables into the component’s HTML template using JSX-like expressions! ### Variables [Section titled “Variables”](#variables) Local variables can be added into the HTML using the curly braces syntax: src/components/Variables.astro ```astro --- const name = "Astro"; --- <div> <h1>Hello {name}!</h1> <!-- Outputs <h1>Hello Astro!</h1> --> </div> ``` ### Dynamic Attributes [Section titled “Dynamic Attributes”](#dynamic-attributes) Local variables can be used in curly braces to pass attribute values to both HTML elements and components: src/components/DynamicAttributes.astro ```astro --- const name = "Astro"; --- <h1 class={name}>Attribute expressions are supported</h1> <MyComponent templateLiteralNameAttribute={`MyNameIs${name}`} /> ``` Caution HTML attributes will be converted to strings, so it is not possible to pass functions and objects to HTML elements. For example, you can’t assign an event handler to an HTML element in an Astro component: dont-do-this.astro ```astro --- function handleClick () { console.log("button clicked!"); } --- <!-- ❌ This doesn't work! ❌ --> <button onClick={handleClick}>Nothing will happen when you click me!</button> ``` Instead, use a client-side script to add the event handler, like you would in vanilla JavaScript: do-this-instead.astro ```astro --- --- <button id="button">Click Me</button> <script> function handleClick () { console.log("button clicked!"); } document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", handleClick); </script> ``` ### Dynamic HTML [Section titled “Dynamic HTML”](#dynamic-html) Local variables can be used in JSX-like functions to produce dynamically-generated HTML elements: src/components/DynamicHtml.astro ```astro --- const items = ["Dog", "Cat", "Platypus"]; --- <ul> {items.map((item) => ( <li>{item}</li> ))} </ul> ``` Astro can conditionally display HTML using JSX logical operators and ternary expressions. src/components/ConditionalHtml.astro ```astro --- const visible = true; --- {visible && <p>Show me!</p>} {visible ? <p>Show me!</p> : <p>Else show me!</p>} ``` ### Dynamic Tags [Section titled “Dynamic Tags”](#dynamic-tags) You can also use dynamic tags by assigning an HTML tag name to a variable or with a component import reassignment: src/components/DynamicTags.astro ```astro --- import MyComponent from "./MyComponent.astro"; const Element = 'div' const Component = MyComponent; --- <Element>Hello!</Element> <!-- renders as <div>Hello!</div> --> <Component /> <!-- renders as <MyComponent /> --> ``` When using dynamic tags: * **Variable names must be capitalized.** For example, use `Element`, not `element`. Otherwise, Astro will try to render your variable name as a literal HTML tag. * **Hydration directives are not supported.** When using [`client:*` hydration directives](/en/guides/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components), Astro needs to know which components to bundle for production, and the dynamic tag pattern prevents this from working. * **The [define:vars directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars) is not supported.** If you cannot wrap the children with an extra element (e.g `<div>`), then you can manually add a ``style={`--myVar:${value}`}`` to your Element. ### Fragments [Section titled “Fragments”](#fragments) Astro supports `<> </>` notation and also provides a built-in `<Fragment />` component. This component can be useful to avoid wrapper elements when adding [`set:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml) to inject an HTML string. The following example renders paragraph text using the `<Fragment />` component: src/components/SetHtml.astro ```astro --- const htmlString = '<p>Raw HTML content</p>'; --- <Fragment set:html={htmlString} /> ``` ### Differences between Astro and JSX [Section titled “Differences between Astro and JSX”](#differences-between-astro-and-jsx) Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience, but there are a couple of key differences between `.astro` files and JSX. #### Attributes [Section titled “Attributes”](#attributes) In Astro, you use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. This even works for `class`, which is not supported by React. example.astro ```diff <div className="box" dataValue="3" /> <div class="box" data-value="3" /> ``` #### Multiple Elements [Section titled “Multiple Elements”](#multiple-elements) An Astro component template can render multiple elements with no need to wrap everything in a single `<div>` or `<>`, unlike JavaScript or JSX. src/components/RootElements.astro ```astro --- // Template with multiple elements --- <p>No need to wrap elements in a single containing element.</p> <p>Astro supports multiple root elements in a template.</p> ``` #### Comments [Section titled “Comments”](#comments) In Astro, you can use standard HTML comments or JavaScript-style comments. example.astro ```astro --- --- <!-- HTML comment syntax is valid in .astro files --> {/* JS comment syntax is also valid */} ``` Caution HTML-style comments will be included in browser DOM, while JS ones will be skipped. To leave TODO messages or other development-only explanations, you may wish to use JavaScript-style comments instead. ## Component utilities [Section titled “Component utilities”](#component-utilities) ### `Astro.slots` [Section titled “Astro.slots”](#astroslots) `Astro.slots` contains utility functions for modifying an Astro component’s slotted children. #### `Astro.slots.has()` [Section titled “Astro.slots.has()”](#astroslotshas) **Type:** `(slotName: string) => boolean` You can check whether content for a specific slot name exists with `Astro.slots.has()`. This can be useful when you want to wrap slot contents but only want to render the wrapper elements when the slot is being used. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- --- <slot /> {Astro.slots.has('more') && ( <aside> <h2>More</h2> <slot name="more" /> </aside> )} ``` #### `Astro.slots.render()` [Section titled “Astro.slots.render()”](#astroslotsrender) **Type:** `(slotName: string, args?: any[]) => Promise<string>` You can asynchronously render the contents of a slot to a string of HTML using `Astro.slots.render()`. ```astro --- const html = await Astro.slots.render('default'); --- <Fragment set:html={html} /> ``` `Astro.slots.render()` optionally accepts a second argument: an array of parameters that will be forwarded to any function children. This can be useful for custom utility components. For example, this `<Shout />` component converts its `message` prop to uppercase and passes it to the default slot: src/components/Shout.astro ```astro --- const message = Astro.props.message.toUpperCase(); let html = ''; if (Astro.slots.has('default')) { html = await Astro.slots.render('default', [message]); } --- <Fragment set:html={html} /> ``` A callback function passed as `<Shout />`’s child will receive the all-caps `message` parameter: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Shout from "../components/Shout.astro"; --- <Shout message="slots!"> {(message) => <div>{message}</div>} </Shout> <!-- renders as <div>SLOTS!</div> --> ``` Callback functions can be passed to named slots inside a wrapping HTML element tag with a `slot` attribute. This element is only used to transfer the callback to a named slot and will not be rendered onto the page. ```astro <Shout message="slots!"> <fragment slot="message"> {(message) => <div>{message}</div>} </fragment> </Shout> ``` Use a standard HTML element for the wrapping tag or any lowercase tag (e.g. `<fragment>` instead of `<Fragment />`) that will not be interpreted as a component. Do not use the HTML `<slot>` element as this will be interpreted as an Astro slot. ### `Astro.self` [Section titled “Astro.self”](#astroself) `Astro.self` allows Astro components to be recursively called. This behavior lets you render an Astro component from within itself by using `<Astro.self>` in the component template. This can help iterate over large data stores and nested data structures. NestedList.astro ```astro --- const { items } = Astro.props; --- <ul class="nested-list"> {items.map((item) => ( <li> <!-- If there is a nested data-structure we render `<Astro.self>` --> <!-- and can pass props through with the recursive call --> {Array.isArray(item) ? ( <Astro.self items={item} /> ) : ( item )} </li> ))} </ul> ``` This component could then be used like this: ```astro --- import NestedList from './NestedList.astro'; --- <NestedList items={['A', ['B', 'C'], 'D']} /> ``` And would render HTML like this: ```html <ul class="nested-list"> <li>A</li> <li> <ul class="nested-list"> <li>B</li> <li>C</li> </ul> </li> <li>D</li> </ul> ```

# CLI Commands

You can use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) provided by Astro to develop, build, and preview your project from a terminal window. ### `astro` commands [Section titled “astro commands”](#astro-commands) Use the CLI by running one of the **commands** documented on this page with your preferred package manager, optionally followed by any **flags**. Flags customize the behavior of a command. One of the commands you’ll use most often is `astro dev`. This command starts the development server and gives you a live, updating preview of your site in a browser as you work: * npm ```shell # start the development server npx astro dev ``` * pnpm ```shell # start the development server pnpm astro dev ``` * Yarn ```shell # start the development server yarn astro dev ``` You can type `astro --help` in your terminal to display a list of all available commands: * npm ```shell npx astro --help ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm astro --help ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn astro --help ``` The following message will display in your terminal: ```bash astro [command] [...flags] Commands add Add an integration. build Build your project and write it to disk. check Check your project for errors. create-key Create a cryptography key dev Start the development server. docs Open documentation in your web browser. info List info about your current Astro setup. preview Preview your build locally. sync Generate TypeScript types for all Astro modules. preferences Configure user preferences. telemetry Configure telemetry settings. Global Flags --config <path> Specify your config file. --root <path> Specify your project root folder. --site <url> Specify your project site. --base <pathname> Specify your project base. --verbose Enable verbose logging. --silent Disable all logging. --version Show the version number and exit. --help Show this help message. ``` You can add the `--help` flag after any command to get a list of all the flags for that command. * npm ```shell # get a list of all flags for the `dev` command npm run dev -- --help ``` * pnpm ```shell # get a list of all flags for the `dev` command pnpm dev --help ``` * Yarn ```shell # get a list of all flags for the `dev` command yarn dev --help ``` The following message will display in your terminal: ```bash astro dev [...flags] Flags --port Specify which port to run on. Defaults to 4321. --host Listen on all addresses, including LAN and public addresses. --host <custom-address> Expose on a network IP address at <custom-address> --open Automatically open the app in the browser on server start --force Clear the content layer cache, forcing a full rebuild. --help (-h) See all available flags. ``` ### `package.json` scripts [Section titled “package.json scripts”](#packagejson-scripts) You can also use scripts in `package.json` for shorter versions of these commands. Using a script allows you to use the same commands that you may be familiar with from other projects, such as `npm run build`. The following scripts for the most common `astro` commands (`astro dev`, `astro build`, and `astro preview`) are added for you automatically when you create a project using [the `create astro` wizard](/en/install-and-setup/). When you follow the instructions to [install Astro manually](/en/install-and-setup/#manual-setup), you are instructed to add these scripts yourself. You can also add more scripts to this list manually for any commands you use frequently. package.json ```json { "scripts": { "dev": "astro dev", "build": "astro build", "preview": "astro preview" } } ``` You will often use these `astro` commands, or the scripts that run them, without any flags. Add flags to the command when you want to customize the command’s behavior. For example, you may wish to start the development server on a different port, or build your site with verbose logs for debugging. * npm ```shell # run the dev server on port 8080 using the `dev` script in `package.json` npm run dev -- --port 8080 # build your site with verbose logs using the `build` script in `package.json` npm run build -- --verbose ``` * pnpm ```shell # run the dev server on port 8080 using the `dev` script in `package.json` pnpm dev --port 8080 # build your site with verbose logs using the `build` script in `package.json` pnpm build --verbose ``` * Yarn ```shell # run the dev server on port 8080 using the `dev` script in `package.json` yarn dev --port 8080 # build your site with verbose logs using the `build` script in `package.json` yarn build --verbose ``` ## `astro dev` [Section titled “astro dev”](#astro-dev) Runs Astro’s development server. This is a local HTTP server that doesn’t bundle assets. It uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to update your browser as you save changes in your editor. The following hotkeys can be used in the terminal where the Astro development server is running: * `s + enter` to sync the content layer data (content and types). * `o + enter` to open your Astro site in the browser. * `q + enter` to quit the development server. ## `astro build` [Section titled “astro build”](#astro-build) Builds your site for deployment. By default, this will generate static files and place them in a `dist/` directory. If any routes are [rendered on demand](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/), this will generate the necessary server files to serve your site. ### Flags The command accepts [common flags](#common-flags) and the following additional flags: #### `--devOutput` [Section titled “--devOutput”](#--devoutput) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Outputs a development-based build similar to code transformed in `astro dev`. This can be useful to test build-only issues with additional debugging information included. ## `astro preview` [Section titled “astro preview”](#astro-preview) Starts a local server to serve the contents of your static directory (`dist/` by default) created by running `astro build`. This command allows you to preview your site locally [after building](#astro-build) to catch any errors in your build output before deploying it. It is not designed to be run in production. For help with production hosting, check out our guide on [Deploying an Astro Website](/en/guides/deploy/). The following hotkeys can be used in the terminal where the Astro preview server is running: * `o` + `enter` to open your Astro site in the browser. * `q` + `enter` to quit the preview server. The `astro preview` command can be combined with the [common flags](#common-flags) documented below to further control the preview experience. ## `astro check` [Section titled “astro check”](#astro-check) Runs diagnostics (such as type-checking within `.astro` files) against your project and reports errors to the console. If any errors are found the process will exit with a code of **1**. This command is intended to be used in CI workflows. ### Flags Use these flags to customize the behavior of the command. #### `--watch` [Section titled “--watch”](#--watch) The command will watch for any changes in your project, and will report any errors. #### `--root <path-to-dir>` [Section titled “--root \<path-to-dir>”](#--root-path-to-dir) Specifies a different root directory to check. Uses the current working directory by default. #### `--tsconfig <path-to-file>` [Section titled “--tsconfig \<path-to-file>”](#--tsconfig-path-to-file) Specifies a `tsconfig.json` file to use manually. If not provided, Astro will attempt to find a config, or infer the project’s config automatically. #### `--minimumFailingSeverity <error|warning|hint>` [Section titled “--minimumFailingSeverity \<error|warning|hint>”](#--minimumfailingseverity-errorwarninghint) Specifies the minimum severity needed to exit with an error code. Defaults to `error`. For example, running `astro check --minimumFailingSeverity warning` will cause the command to exit with an error if any warnings are detected. #### `--minimumSeverity <error|warning|hint>` [Section titled “--minimumSeverity \<error|warning|hint>”](#--minimumseverity-errorwarninghint) Specifies the minimum severity to output. Defaults to `hint`. For example, running `astro check --minimumSeverity warning` will show errors and warning, but not hints. #### `--preserveWatchOutput` [Section titled “--preserveWatchOutput”](#--preservewatchoutput) Specifies not to clear the output between checks when in watch mode. #### `--noSync` [Section titled “--noSync”](#--nosync) Specifies not to run `astro sync` before checking the project. Read more about [type checking in Astro](/en/guides/typescript/#type-checking). ## `astro sync` [Section titled “astro sync”](#astro-sync) **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` Generates TypeScript types for all Astro modules. This sets up a [`.astro/types.d.ts` file](/en/guides/typescript/#setup) for type inferencing, and defines modules for features that rely on generated types: * The `astro:content` module for the [Content Collections API](/en/guides/content-collections/). * The `astro:db` module for [Astro DB](/en/guides/astro-db/). * The `astro:env` module for [Astro Env](/en/guides/environment-variables/). * The `astro:actions` module for [Astro Actions](/en/guides/actions/) ## `astro add` [Section titled “astro add”](#astro-add) Adds an integration to your configuration. Read more in [the integrations guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#automatic-integration-setup). ## `astro docs` [Section titled “astro docs”](#astro-docs) Launches the Astro Docs website directly from the terminal. ## `astro info` [Section titled “astro info”](#astro-info) Reports useful information about your current Astro environment. Useful for providing information when opening an issue. ```shell astro info ``` Example output: ```plaintext Astro v5.14.1 Vite v6.3.6 Node v22.17.1 System macOS (arm64) Package Manager npm Output static Adapter none Integrations @astrojs/starlight (v0.35.3) ``` ### Flags Use the following flags to customize the behavior of the command. #### `--copy` [Section titled “--copy”](#--copy) The command will copy the output to the clipboard without prompting. ## `astro preferences` [Section titled “astro preferences”](#astro-preferences) Manage user preferences with the `astro preferences` command. User preferences are specific to individual Astro users, unlike the `astro.config.mjs` file which changes behavior for everyone working on a project. User preferences are scoped to the current project by default, stored in a local `.astro/settings.json` file. Using the `--global` flag, user preferences can also be applied to every Astro project on the current machine. Global user preferences are stored in an operating system-specific location. ### Available preferences * `devToolbar` — Enable or disable the development toolbar in the browser. (Default: `true`) * `checkUpdates` — Enable or disable automatic update checks for the Astro CLI. (Default: `true`) The `list` command prints the current settings of all configurable user preferences. It also supports a machine-readable `--json` output. ```shell astro preferences list ``` Example terminal output: | Preference | Value | | -------------------- | ----- | | devToolbar.enabled | true | | | | | checkUpdates.enabled | true | You can `enable`, `disable`, or `reset` preferences to their default. For example, to disable the devToolbar in a specific Astro project: ```shell astro preferences disable devToolbar ``` To disable the devToolbar in all Astro projects on the current machine: ```shell astro preferences disable --global devToolbar ``` The devToolbar can later be enabled with: ```shell astro preferences enable devToolbar ``` The `reset` command resets a preference to its default value: ```shell astro preferences reset devToolbar ``` ## `astro telemetry` [Section titled “astro telemetry”](#astro-telemetry) Sets telemetry configuration for the current CLI user. Telemetry is anonymous data that provides the Astro team insights into which Astro features are most often used. For more information see [Astro’s telemetry page](https://astro.build/telemetry/). Telemetry can be disabled with this CLI command: ```shell astro telemetry disable ``` Telemetry can later be re-enabled with: ```shell astro telemetry enable ``` The `reset` command resets the telemetry data: ```shell astro telemetry reset ``` ## `astro create-key` [Section titled “astro create-key”](#astro-create-key) Generates a key to encrypt props passed to server islands. ```shell astro create-key ``` Set this key as the `ASTRO_KEY` environment variable (e.g. in a `.env` file) and include it in your CI/CD or host’s build settings when you need [a constant encryption key for your server islands](/en/guides/server-islands/#reusing-the-encryption-key) for situations like rolling deployments, multi-region hosting or a CDN that caches pages containing server islands. ## Common flags [Section titled “Common flags”](#common-flags) ### `--root <path>` [Section titled “--root \<path>”](#--root-path) Specifies the path to the project root. If not specified, the current working directory is assumed to be the root. The root is used for finding the Astro configuration file. ```shell astro --root myRootFolder/myProjectFolder dev ``` ### `--config <path>` [Section titled “--config \<path>”](#--config-path) Specifies the path to the config file relative to the project root. Defaults to `astro.config.mjs`. Use this if you use a different name for your configuration file or have your config file in another folder. ```shell astro --config config/astro.config.mjs dev ``` ### `--force <string>` [Section titled “--force \<string>”](#--force-string) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Clear the [content layer cache](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-the-collection-loader), forcing a full rebuild. ### `--mode <string>` [Section titled “--mode \<string>”](#--mode-string) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Configures the [`mode`](/en/reference/programmatic-reference/#mode) inline config for your project. ### `--outDir <path>` [Section titled “--outDir \<path>”](#--outdir-path) **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` Configures the [`outDir`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#outdir) for your project. Passing this flag will override the `outDir` value in your `astro.config.mjs` file, if one exists. ### `--site <url>` [Section titled “--site \<url>”](#--site-url) Configures the [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) for your project. Passing this flag will override the `site` value in your `astro.config.mjs` file, if one exists. ### `--base <pathname>` [Section titled “--base \<pathname>”](#--base-pathname) **Added in:** `astro@1.4.1` Configures the [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) for your project. Passing this flag will override the `base` value in your `astro.config.mjs` file, if one exists. ### `--port <number>` [Section titled “--port \<number>”](#--port-number) Specifies which port to run the dev server and preview server on. Defaults to `4321`. ### `--host [optional host address]` [Section titled “--host \[optional host address\]”](#--host-optional-host-address) Sets which network IP addresses the dev server and preview server should listen on (i.e. non-localhost IPs). This can be useful for testing your project on local devices like a mobile phone during development. * `--host` — listen on all addresses, including LAN and public addresses * `--host <custom-address>` — expose on a network IP address at `<custom-address>` Caution Do not use the `--host` flag to expose the dev server and preview server in a production environment. The servers are designed for local use while developing your site only. ### `--allowed-hosts` [Section titled “--allowed-hosts”](#--allowed-hosts) **Added in:** `astro@5.4.0` Specifies the hostnames that Astro is allowed to respond to in `dev` or `preview` modes. Can be passed a comma-separated list of hostnames or `true` to allow any hostname. Refer to [Vite’s `allowedHosts` feature](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) for more information, including security implications of allowing hostnames. ### `--verbose` [Section titled “--verbose”](#--verbose) Enables verbose logging, which is helpful when debugging an issue. ### `--silent` [Section titled “--silent”](#--silent) Enables silent logging, which will run the server without any console output. ### `--open` [Section titled “--open”](#--open) Automatically opens the app in the browser on server start. Can be passed a full URL string (e.g. `--open http://example.com`) or a pathname (e.g. `--open /about`) to specify the URL to open. ## Global flags [Section titled “Global flags”](#global-flags) Use these flags to get information about the `astro` CLI. ### `--version` [Section titled “--version”](#--version) Prints the Astro version number and exits. ### `--help` [Section titled “--help”](#--help) Prints the help message and exits.

# Configuration Reference

The following reference covers all supported configuration options in Astro. To learn more about configuring Astro, read our guide on [Configuring Astro](/en/guides/configuring-astro/). astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config' export default defineConfig({ // your configuration options here... }) ``` ## Top-Level Options [Section titled “Top-Level Options”](#top-level-options) ### site [Section titled “site”](#site) **Type:** `string` Your final, deployed URL. Astro uses this full URL to generate your sitemap and canonical URLs in your final build. It is strongly recommended that you set this configuration to get the most out of Astro. ```js { site: 'https://www.my-site.dev' } ``` ### base [Section titled “base”](#base) **Type:** `string` The base path to deploy to. Astro will use this path as the root for your pages and assets both in development and in production build. In the example below, `astro dev` will start your server at `/docs`. ```js { base: '/docs' } ``` When using this option, all of your static asset imports and URLs should add the base as a prefix. You can access this value via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. The value of `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` will be determined by your `trailingSlash` config, no matter what value you have set for `base`. A trailing slash is always included if `trailingSlash: "always"` is set. If `trailingSlash: "never"` is set, `BASE_URL` will not include a trailing slash, even if `base` includes one. Additionally, Astro will internally manipulate the configured value of `config.base` before making it available to integrations. The value of `config.base` as read by integrations will also be determined by your `trailingSlash` configuration in the same way. In the example below, the values of `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` and `config.base` when processed will both be `/docs`: ```js { base: '/docs/', trailingSlash: "never" } ``` In the example below, the values of `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` and `config.base` when processed will both be `/docs/`: ```js { base: '/docs', trailingSlash: "always" } ``` ### trailingSlash [Section titled “trailingSlash”](#trailingslash) **Type:** `'always' | 'never' | 'ignore'`\ **Default:** `'ignore'` Set the route matching behavior for trailing slashes in the dev server and on-demand rendered pages. Choose from the following options: * `'ignore'` - Match URLs regardless of whether a trailing ”/” exists. Requests for “/about” and “/about/” will both match the same route. * `'always'` - Only match URLs that include a trailing slash (e.g: “/about/”). In production, requests for on-demand rendered URLs without a trailing slash will be redirected to the correct URL for your convenience. However, in development, they will display a warning page reminding you that you have `always` configured. * `'never'` - Only match URLs that do not include a trailing slash (e.g: “/about”). In production, requests for on-demand rendered URLs with a trailing slash will be redirected to the correct URL for your convenience. However, in development, they will display a warning page reminding you that you have `never` configured. When redirects occur in production for GET requests, the redirect will be a 301 (permanent) redirect. For all other request methods, it will be a 308 (permanent, and preserve the request method) redirect. Trailing slashes on prerendered pages are handled by the hosting platform, and may not respect your chosen configuration. See your hosting platform’s documentation for more information. You cannot use Astro [redirects](#redirects) for this use case at this point. ```js { // Example: Require a trailing slash during development trailingSlash: 'always' } ``` **See Also:** * build.format ### redirects [Section titled “redirects”](#redirects) **Type:** `Record<string, RedirectConfig>`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@2.9.0` Specify a mapping of redirects where the key is the route to match and the value is the path to redirect to. You can redirect both static and dynamic routes, but only to the same kind of route. For example, you cannot have a `'/article': '/blog/[...slug]'` redirect. ```js export default defineConfig({ redirects: { '/old': '/new', '/blog/[...slug]': '/articles/[...slug]', '/about': 'https://example.com/about', '/news': { status: 302, destination: 'https://example.com/news' }, // '/product1/', '/product1' // Note, this is not supported } }) ``` For statically-generated sites with no adapter installed, this will produce a client redirect using a [`<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#http-equiv) and does not support status codes. When using SSR or with a static adapter in `output: static` mode, status codes are supported. Astro will serve redirected GET requests with a status of `301` and use a status of `308` for any other request method. You can customize the [redirection status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) using an object in the redirect config: ```js export default defineConfig({ redirects: { '/other': { status: 302, destination: '/place', }, } }) ``` ### output [Section titled “output”](#output) **Type:** `'static' | 'server'`\ **Default:** `'static'` Specifies the output target for builds. * `'static'` - Prerender all your pages by default, outputting a completely static site if none of your pages opt out of prerendering. * `'server'` - Use server-side rendering (SSR) for all pages by default, always outputting a server-rendered site. ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ output: 'static' }) ``` **See Also:** * adapter ### adapter [Section titled “adapter”](#adapter) **Type:** `AstroIntegration` Deploy to your favorite server, serverless, or edge host with build adapters. Import one of our first-party adapters ([Cloudflare](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/), [Netlify](/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/), [Node.js](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/), [Vercel](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/)) or explore [community adapters](https://astro.build/integrations/2/?search=\&categories%5B%5D=adapters) to enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project. See our [on-demand rendering guide](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) for more on Astro’s server rendering options. ```js import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify'; { // Example: Build for Netlify serverless deployment adapter: netlify(), } ``` **See Also:** * output ### integrations [Section titled “integrations”](#integrations) **Type:** `AstroIntegration[]` Extend Astro with custom integrations. Integrations are your one-stop-shop for adding framework support (like Solid.js), new features (like sitemaps), and new libraries (like Partytown). Read our [Integrations Guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for help getting started with Astro Integrations. ```js import react from '@astrojs/react'; import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx'; { // Example: Add React + MDX support to Astro integrations: [react(), mdx()] } ``` ### root [Section titled “root”](#root) **Type:** `string`\ **CLI:** `--root`\ **Default:** `"."` (current working directory) You should only provide this option if you run the `astro` CLI commands in a directory other than the project root directory. Usually, this option is provided via the CLI instead of the Astro config file, since Astro needs to know your project root before it can locate your config file. If you provide a relative path (ex: `--root: './my-project'`) Astro will resolve it against your current working directory. #### Examples [Section titled “Examples”](#examples) ```js { root: './my-project-directory' } ``` ```bash $ astro build --root ./my-project-directory ``` ### srcDir [Section titled “srcDir”](#srcdir) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `"./src"` Set the directory that Astro will read your site from. The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root. ```js { srcDir: './www' } ``` ### publicDir [Section titled “publicDir”](#publicdir) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `"./public"` Set the directory for your static assets. Files in this directory are served at `/` during dev and copied to your build directory during build. These files are always served or copied as-is, without transform or bundling. The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root. ```js { publicDir: './my-custom-publicDir-directory' } ``` ### outDir [Section titled “outDir”](#outdir) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `"./dist"` Set the directory that `astro build` writes your final build to. The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root. ```js { outDir: './my-custom-build-directory' } ``` **See Also:** * build.server ### cacheDir [Section titled “cacheDir”](#cachedir) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `"./node_modules/.astro"` Set the directory for caching build artifacts. Files in this directory will be used in subsequent builds to speed up the build time. The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root. ```js { cacheDir: './my-custom-cache-directory' } ``` ### compressHTML [Section titled “compressHTML”](#compresshtml) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` This is an option to minify your HTML output and reduce the size of your HTML files. By default, Astro removes whitespace from your HTML, including line breaks, from `.astro` components in a lossless manner. Some whitespace may be kept as needed to preserve the visual rendering of your HTML. This occurs both in development mode and in the final build. To disable HTML compression, set `compressHTML` to false. ```js { compressHTML: false } ``` ### scopedStyleStrategy [Section titled “scopedStyleStrategy”](#scopedstylestrategy) **Type:** `'where' | 'class' | 'attribute'`\ **Default:** `'attribute'` **Added in:** `astro@2.4` Specify the strategy used for scoping styles within Astro components. Choose from: * `'where'` - Use `:where` selectors, causing no specificity increase. * `'class'` - Use class-based selectors, causing a +1 specificity increase. * `'attribute'` - Use `data-` attributes, causing a +1 specificity increase. Using `'class'` is helpful when you want to ensure that element selectors within an Astro component override global style defaults (e.g. from a global stylesheet). Using `'where'` gives you more control over specificity, but requires that you use higher-specificity selectors, layers, and other tools to control which selectors are applied. Using `'attribute'` is useful when you are manipulating the `class` attribute of elements and need to avoid conflicts between your own styling logic and Astro’s application of styles. ### security [Section titled “security”](#security) **Type:** `Record<"checkOrigin", boolean> | undefined`\ **Default:** `{checkOrigin: true}` **Added in:** `astro@4.9.0` Enables security measures for an Astro website. These features only exist for pages rendered on demand (SSR) using `server` mode or pages that opt out of prerendering in `static` mode. By default, Astro will automatically check that the “origin” header matches the URL sent by each request in on-demand rendered pages. You can disable this behavior by setting `checkOrigin` to `false`: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ output: "server", security: { checkOrigin: false } }) ``` #### security.checkOrigin [Section titled “security.checkOrigin”](#securitycheckorigin) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@4.9.0` Performs a check that the “origin” header, automatically passed by all modern browsers, matches the URL sent by each `Request`. This is used to provide Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. The “origin” check is executed only for pages rendered on demand, and only for the requests `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` and `PUT` with one of the following `content-type` headers: `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`, `'multipart/form-data'`, `'text/plain'`. If the “origin” header doesn’t match the `pathname` of the request, Astro will return a 403 status code and will not render the page. #### security.allowedDomains [Section titled “security.allowedDomains”](#securityalloweddomains) **Type:** `Array<RemotePattern>`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@5.14.2` Defines a list of permitted host patterns for incoming requests when using SSR. When configured, Astro will validate the `X-Forwarded-Host` header against these patterns for security. If the header doesn’t match any allowed pattern, the header is ignored and the request’s original host is used instead. This prevents host header injection attacks where malicious actors can manipulate the `Astro.url` value by sending crafted `X-Forwarded-Host` headers. Each pattern can specify `protocol`, `hostname`, and `port`. All three are validated if provided. The patterns support wildcards for flexible hostname matching: ```js { security: { // Example: Allow any subdomain of example.com on https allowedDomains: [ { hostname: '**.example.com', protocol: 'https' }, { hostname: 'staging.myapp.com', protocol: 'https', port: '443' } ] } } ``` When not configured, `X-Forwarded-Host` headers are not trusted and will be ignored. ### vite [Section titled “vite”](#vite) **Type:** `ViteUserConfig` Pass additional configuration options to Vite. Useful when Astro doesn’t support some advanced configuration that you may need. View the full `vite` configuration object documentation on [vite.dev](https://vite.dev/config/). #### Examples [Section titled “Examples”](#examples-1) ```js { vite: { ssr: { // Example: Force a broken package to skip SSR processing, if needed external: ['broken-npm-package'], } } } ``` ```js { vite: { // Example: Add custom vite plugins directly to your Astro project plugins: [myPlugin()], } } ``` ## Build Options [Section titled “Build Options”](#build-options) ### build.format [Section titled “build.format”](#buildformat) **Type:** `('file' | 'directory' | 'preserve')`\ **Default:** `'directory'` Control the output file format of each page. This value may be set by an adapter for you. * `'file'`: Astro will generate an HTML file named for each page route. (e.g. `src/pages/about.astro` and `src/pages/about/index.astro` both build the file `/about.html`) * `'directory'`: Astro will generate a directory with a nested `index.html` file for each page. (e.g. `src/pages/about.astro` and `src/pages/about/index.astro` both build the file `/about/index.html`) * `'preserve'`: Astro will generate HTML files exactly as they appear in your source folder. (e.g. `src/pages/about.astro` builds `/about.html` and `src/pages/about/index.astro` builds the file `/about/index.html`) ```js { build: { // Example: Generate `page.html` instead of `page/index.html` during build. format: 'file' } } ``` #### Effect on Astro.url [Section titled “Effect on Astro.url”](#effect-on-astrourl) Setting `build.format` controls what `Astro.url` is set to during the build. When it is: * `directory` - The `Astro.url.pathname` will include a trailing slash to mimic folder behavior. (e.g. `/foo/`) * `file` - The `Astro.url.pathname` will include `.html`. (e.g. `/foo.html`) This means that when you create relative URLs using `new URL('./relative', Astro.url)`, you will get consistent behavior between dev and build. To prevent inconsistencies with trailing slash behaviour in dev, you can restrict the [`trailingSlash` option](#trailingslash) to `'always'` or `'never'` depending on your build format: * `directory` - Set `trailingSlash: 'always'` * `file` - Set `trailingSlash: 'never'` ### build.client [Section titled “build.client”](#buildclient) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `'./client'` Controls the output directory of your client-side CSS and JavaScript when building a website with server-rendered pages. `outDir` controls where the code is built to. This value is relative to the `outDir`. ```js { output: 'server', build: { client: './client' } } ``` ### build.server [Section titled “build.server”](#buildserver) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `'./server'` Controls the output directory of server JavaScript when building to SSR. This value is relative to the `outDir`. ```js { build: { server: './server' } } ``` ### build.assets [Section titled “build.assets”](#buildassets) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `'_astro'` **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` Specifies the directory in the build output where Astro-generated assets (bundled JS and CSS for example) should live. ```js { build: { assets: '_custom' } } ``` **See Also:** * outDir ### build.assetsPrefix [Section titled “build.assetsPrefix”](#buildassetsprefix) **Type:** `string | Record<string, string>`\ **Default:** `undefined` **Added in:** `astro@2.2.0` Specifies the prefix for Astro-generated asset links. This can be used if assets are served from a different domain than the current site. This requires uploading the assets in your local `./dist/_astro` folder to a corresponding `/_astro/` folder on the remote domain. To rename the `_astro` path, specify a new directory in `build.assets`. To fetch all assets uploaded to the same domain (e.g. `https://cdn.example.com/_astro/...`), set `assetsPrefix` to the root domain as a string (regardless of your `base` configuration): ```js { build: { assetsPrefix: 'https://cdn.example.com' } } ``` **Added in:** `astro@4.5.0` You can also pass an object to `assetsPrefix` to specify a different domain for each file type. In this case, a `fallback` property is required and will be used by default for any other files. ```js { build: { assetsPrefix: { 'js': 'https://js.cdn.example.com', 'mjs': 'https://js.cdn.example.com', 'css': 'https://css.cdn.example.com', 'fallback': 'https://cdn.example.com' } } } ``` ### build.serverEntry [Section titled “build.serverEntry”](#buildserverentry) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `'entry.mjs'` Specifies the file name of the server entrypoint when building to SSR. This entrypoint is usually dependent on which host you are deploying to and will be set by your adapter for you. Note that it is recommended that this file ends with `.mjs` so that the runtime detects that the file is a JavaScript module. ```js { build: { serverEntry: 'main.mjs' } } ``` ### build.redirects [Section titled “build.redirects”](#buildredirects) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@2.6.0` Specifies whether redirects will be output to HTML during the build. This option only applies to `output: 'static'` mode; in SSR redirects are treated the same as all responses. This option is mostly meant to be used by adapters that have special configuration files for redirects and do not need/want HTML based redirects. ```js { build: { redirects: false } } ``` ### build.inlineStylesheets [Section titled “build.inlineStylesheets”](#buildinlinestylesheets) **Type:** `'always' | 'auto' | 'never'`\ **Default:** `auto` **Added in:** `astro@2.6.0` Control whether project styles are sent to the browser in a separate css file or inlined into `<style>` tags. Choose from the following options: * `'always'` - project styles are inlined into `<style>` tags * `'auto'` - only stylesheets smaller than `ViteConfig.build.assetsInlineLimit` (default: 4kb) are inlined. Otherwise, project styles are sent in external stylesheets. * `'never'` - project styles are sent in external stylesheets ```js { build: { inlineStylesheets: `never`, }, } ``` ### build.concurrency [Section titled “build.concurrency”](#buildconcurrency) **Type:** `number`\ **Default:** `1` **Added in:** `astro@4.16.0` The number of pages to build in parallel. **In most cases, you should not change the default value of `1`.** Use this option only when other attempts to reduce the overall rendering time (e.g. batch or cache long running tasks like fetch calls or data access) are not possible or are insufficient. If the number is set too high, page rendering may slow down due to insufficient memory resources and because JS is single-threaded. ```js { build: { concurrency: 2 } } ``` Breaking changes possible This feature is stable and is not considered experimental. However, this feature is only intended to address difficult performance issues, and breaking changes may occur in a [minor release](/en/upgrade-astro/#semantic-versioning) to keep this option as performant as possible. Please check the [Astro CHANGELOG](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/refs/heads/next/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for every minor release if you are using this feature. ## Server Options [Section titled “Server Options”](#server-options) Customize the Astro dev server, used by both `astro dev` and `astro preview`. ```js { server: { port: 1234, host: true} } ``` To set different configuration based on the command run (“dev”, “preview”) a function can also be passed to this configuration option. ```js { // Example: Use the function syntax to customize based on command server: ({ command }) => ({ port: command === 'dev' ? 4321 : 4000 }) } ``` ### server.host [Section titled “server.host”](#serverhost) **Type:** `string | boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@0.24.0` Set which network IP addresses the server should listen on (i.e. non-localhost IPs). * `false` - do not expose on a network IP address * `true` - listen on all addresses, including LAN and public addresses * `[custom-address]` - expose on a network IP address at `[custom-address]` (ex: `192.168.0.1`) ### server.port [Section titled “server.port”](#serverport) **Type:** `number`\ **Default:** `4321` Set which port the server should listen on. If the given port is already in use, Astro will automatically try the next available port. ```js { server: { port: 8080 } } ``` ### server.allowedHosts [Section titled “server.allowedHosts”](#serverallowedhosts) **Type:** `Array<string> | true`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@5.4.0` A list of hostnames that Astro is allowed to respond to. When the value is set to `true`, any hostname is allowed. ```js { server: { allowedHosts: ['staging.example.com', 'qa.example.com'] } } ``` ### server.open [Section titled “server.open”](#serveropen) **Type:** `string | boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@4.1.0` Controls whether the dev server should open in your browser window on startup. Pass a full URL string (e.g. “<http://example.com>”) or a pathname (e.g. “/about”) to specify the URL to open. ```js { server: { open: "/about" } } ``` ### server.headers [Section titled “server.headers”](#serverheaders) **Type:** `OutgoingHttpHeaders`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@1.7.0` Set custom HTTP response headers to be sent in `astro dev` and `astro preview`. ## Session Options [Section titled “Session Options”](#session-options) **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` Configures session storage for your Astro project. This is used to store session data in a persistent way, so that it can be accessed across different requests. Some adapters may provide a default session driver, but you can override it with your own configuration. See [the sessions guide](/en/guides/sessions/) for more information. astro.config.mjs ```js { session: { // The name of the Unstorage driver driver: 'redis', // The required options depend on the driver options: { url: process.env.REDIS_URL, }, ttl: 3600, // 1 hour } } ``` ### session.driver [Section titled “session.driver”](#sessiondriver) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` The Unstorage driver to use for session storage. The [Node](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#sessions), [Cloudflare](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#sessions), and [Netlify](/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/#sessions) adapters automatically configure a default driver for you, but you can specify your own if you would prefer or if you are using an adapter that does not provide one. The value is the “Driver name” from the [Unstorage driver documentation](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers). astro.config.mjs ```diff { adapter: vercel(), session: { + driver: "redis", }, } ``` ### session.options [Section titled “session.options”](#sessionoptions) **Type:** `Record<string, unknown> | undefined`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` The driver-specific options to use for session storage. The options depend on the driver you are using. See the [Unstorage documentation](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers) for more information on the options available for each driver. astro.config.mjs ```diff { session: { driver: "redis", + options: { + url: process.env.REDIS_URL + }, } } ``` ### session.cookie [Section titled “session.cookie”](#sessioncookie) **Type:** `string | AstroCookieSetOptions | undefined`\ **Default:** `{ name: "astro-session", sameSite: "lax", httpOnly: true, secure: true }` **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` The session cookie configuration. If set to a string, it will be used as the cookie name. Alternatively, you can pass an object with additional options. These will be merged with the defaults. astro.config.mjs ```diff { session: { +// If set to a string, it will be used as the cookie name. + cookie: "my-session-cookie", } } ``` astro.config.mjs ```diff { session: { // If set to an object, it will be used as the cookie options. + cookie: { + name: "my-session-cookie", + sameSite: "lax", + secure: true, + } } } ``` ### session.ttl [Section titled “session.ttl”](#sessionttl) **Type:** `number | undefined`\ **Default:** Infinity **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` An optional default time-to-live expiration period for session values, in seconds. By default, session values persist until they are deleted or the session is destroyed, and do not automatically expire because a particular amount of time has passed. Set `session.ttl` to add a default expiration period for your session values. Passing a `ttl` option to [`session.set()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#set) will override the global default for that individual entry. astro.config.mjs ```diff { session: { +// Set a default expiration period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) + ttl: 3600, } } ``` ## Dev Toolbar Options [Section titled “Dev Toolbar Options”](#dev-toolbar-options) ### devToolbar.enabled [Section titled “devToolbar.enabled”](#devtoolbarenabled) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` Whether to enable the Astro Dev Toolbar. This toolbar allows you to inspect your page islands, see helpful audits on performance and accessibility, and more. This option is scoped to the entire project, to only disable the toolbar for yourself, run `npm run astro preferences disable devToolbar`. To disable the toolbar for all your Astro projects, run `npm run astro preferences disable devToolbar --global`. ### devToolbar.placement [Section titled “devToolbar.placement”](#devtoolbarplacement) **Type:** `'bottom-left' | 'bottom-center' | 'bottom-right'`\ **Default:** `'bottom-center'` **Added in:** `astro@5.17.0` New The default placement of the Astro Dev Toolbar on the screen. The placement of the toolbar can still be changed via the toolbar settings UI. Once changed, the user’s preference is saved in `localStorage` and overrides this configuration value. ## Prefetch Options [Section titled “Prefetch Options”](#prefetch-options) **Type:** `boolean | object` Enable prefetching for links on your site to provide faster page transitions. (Enabled by default on pages using the `<ClientRouter />` router. Set `prefetch: false` to opt out of this behaviour.) This configuration automatically adds a prefetch script to every page in the project giving you access to the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute. Add this attribute to any `<a />` link on your page to enable prefetching for that page. ```html <a href="/about" data-astro-prefetch>About</a> ``` Further customize the default prefetching behavior using the [`prefetch.defaultStrategy`](#prefetchdefaultstrategy) and [`prefetch.prefetchAll`](#prefetchprefetchall) options. See the [Prefetch guide](/en/guides/prefetch/) for more information. ### prefetch.prefetchAll [Section titled “prefetch.prefetchAll”](#prefetchprefetchall) **Type:** `boolean` Enable prefetching for all links, including those without the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute. This value defaults to `true` when using the `<ClientRouter />` router. Otherwise, the default value is `false`. ```js prefetch: { prefetchAll: true } ``` When set to `true`, you can disable prefetching individually by setting `data-astro-prefetch="false"` on any individual links. ```html <a href="/about" data-astro-prefetch="false">About</a> ``` ### prefetch.defaultStrategy [Section titled “prefetch.defaultStrategy”](#prefetchdefaultstrategy) **Type:** `'tap' | 'hover' | 'viewport' | 'load'`\ **Default:** `'hover'` The default prefetch strategy to use when the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute is set on a link with no value. * `'tap'`: Prefetch just before you click on the link. * `'hover'`: Prefetch when you hover over or focus on the link. (default) * `'viewport'`: Prefetch as the links enter the viewport. * `'load'`: Prefetch all links on the page after the page is loaded. You can override this default value and select a different strategy for any individual link by setting a value on the attribute. ```html <a href="/about" data-astro-prefetch="viewport">About</a> ``` ## Image Options [Section titled “Image Options”](#image-options) ### image.endpoint [Section titled “image.endpoint”](#imageendpoint) **Type:** `Object`\ **Default:** `{route: '/_image', entrypoint: undefined}` **Added in:** `astro@3.1.0` Set the endpoint to use for image optimization in dev and SSR. The `entrypoint` property can be set to `undefined` to use the default image endpoint. ```js { image: { // Example: Use a custom image endpoint at `/custom_endpoint` endpoint: { route: '/custom_endpoint', entrypoint: 'src/my_endpoint.ts', }, }, } ``` ### image.service [Section titled “image.service”](#imageservice) **Type:** `Object`\ **Default:** `{entrypoint: 'astro/assets/services/sharp', config?: {}}` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.0` Set which image service is used for Astro’s assets support. The value should be an object with an entrypoint for the image service to use and optionally, a config object to pass to the service. The service entrypoint can be either one of the included services, or a third-party package. ```js { image: { // Example: Enable the Sharp-based image service with a custom config service: { entrypoint: 'astro/assets/services/sharp', config: { limitInputPixels: false, }, }, }, } ``` #### image.service.config.limitInputPixels [Section titled “image.service.config.limitInputPixels”](#imageserviceconfiglimitinputpixels) **Type:** `number | boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@4.1.0` Whether or not to limit the size of images that the Sharp image service will process. Set `false` to bypass the default image size limit for the Sharp image service and process large images. #### image.service.config.kernel [Section titled “image.service.config.kernel”](#imageserviceconfigkernel) **Type:** `string | undefined`\ **Default:** `undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.17.0` New The default [kernel used for resizing images](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize/#resize) in the Sharp image service. By default this is `undefined`, which maps to Sharp’s default kernel of `lanczos3`. ### image.domains [Section titled “image.domains”](#imagedomains) **Type:** `Array<string>`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@2.10.10` Defines a list of permitted image source domains for remote image optimization. No other remote images will be optimized by Astro. This option requires an array of individual domain names as strings. Wildcards are not permitted. Instead, use [`image.remotePatterns`](#imageremotepatterns) to define a list of allowed source URL patterns. astro.config.mjs ```js { image: { // Example: Allow remote image optimization from a single domain domains: ['astro.build'], }, } ``` ### image.remotePatterns [Section titled “image.remotePatterns”](#imageremotepatterns) **Type:** `Array<RemotePattern>`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@2.10.10` Defines a list of permitted image source URL patterns for remote image optimization. `remotePatterns` can be configured with four properties: 1. protocol 2. hostname 3. port 4. pathname ```js { image: { // Example: allow processing all images from your aws s3 bucket remotePatterns: [{ protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.amazonaws.com', }], }, } ``` You can use wildcards to define the permitted `hostname` and `pathname` values as described below. Otherwise, only the exact values provided will be configured: `hostname`: * Start with ’\*\*.’ to allow all subdomains (‘endsWith’). * Start with ’\*.’ to allow only one level of subdomain. `pathname`: * End with ’/\*\*’ to allow all sub-routes (‘startsWith’). * End with ’/\*’ to allow only one level of sub-route. ### image.responsiveStyles [Section titled “image.responsiveStyles”](#imageresponsivestyles) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` Whether to automatically add global styles for responsive images. You should enable this option unless you are styling the images yourself. This option is only used when `layout` is set to `constrained`, `full-width`, or `fixed` using the configuration or the `layout` prop on the image component. See [the images docs](/en/guides/images/#responsive-image-styles) for more information. ### image.layout [Section titled “image.layout”](#imagelayout) **Type:** `ImageLayout`\ **Default:** `undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` The default layout type for responsive images. Can be overridden by the `layout` prop on the image component. * `constrained` - The image will scale to fit the container, maintaining its aspect ratio, but will not exceed the specified dimensions. * `fixed` - The image will maintain its original dimensions. * `full-width` - The image will scale to fit the container, maintaining its aspect ratio. See [the `layout` component property](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#layout) for more details. ### image.objectFit [Section titled “image.objectFit”](#imageobjectfit) **Type:** `ImageFit`\ **Default:** `"cover"` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` The [`object-fit` CSS property value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) for responsive images. Can be overridden by the `fit` prop on the image component. Requires a value for `layout` to be set. See [the `fit` component property](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#fit) for more details. ### image.objectPosition [Section titled “image.objectPosition”](#imageobjectposition) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `"center"` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` The default [`object-position` CSS property value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) for responsive images. Can be overridden by the `position` prop on the image component. Requires a value for `layout` to be set. See [the `position` component property](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#position) for more details. ### image.breakpoints [Section titled “image.breakpoints”](#imagebreakpoints) **Type:** `Array<number>`\ **Default:** `[640, 750, 828, 1080, 1280, 1668, 2048, 2560] | [640, 750, 828, 960, 1080, 1280, 1668, 1920, 2048, 2560, 3200, 3840, 4480, 5120, 6016]` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` The breakpoints used to generate responsive images. Requires a value for `layout` to be set. The full list is not normally used, but is filtered according to the source and output size. The defaults used depend on whether a local or remote image service is used. For remote services the more comprehensive list is used, because only the required sizes are generated. For local services, the list is shorter to reduce the number of images generated. ## Markdown Options [Section titled “Markdown Options”](#markdown-options) ### markdown.shikiConfig [Section titled “markdown.shikiConfig”](#markdownshikiconfig) **Type:** `Partial<ShikiConfig>` Shiki is our default syntax highlighter. You can configure all options via the `markdown.shikiConfig` object: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ markdown: { shikiConfig: { // Choose from Shiki's built-in themes (or add your own) // https://shiki.style/themes theme: 'dracula', // Alternatively, provide multiple themes // See note below for using dual light/dark themes themes: { light: 'github-light', dark: 'github-dark', }, // Disable the default colors // https://shiki.style/guide/dual-themes#without-default-color // (Added in v4.12.0) defaultColor: false, // Add custom languages // Note: Shiki has countless langs built-in, including .astro! // https://shiki.style/languages langs: [], // Add custom aliases for languages // Map an alias to a Shiki language ID: https://shiki.style/languages#bundled-languages // https://shiki.style/guide/load-lang#custom-language-aliases langAlias: { cjs: "javascript" }, // Enable word wrap to prevent horizontal scrolling wrap: true, // Add custom transformers: https://shiki.style/guide/transformers // Find common transformers: https://shiki.style/packages/transformers transformers: [], }, }, }); ``` See the [code syntax highlighting guide](/en/guides/syntax-highlighting/) for usage and examples. ### markdown.syntaxHighlight [Section titled “markdown.syntaxHighlight”](#markdownsyntaxhighlight) **Type:** `SyntaxHighlightConfig | SyntaxHighlightConfigType | false`\ **Default:** `{ type: 'shiki', excludeLangs: ['math'] }` Which syntax highlighter to use for Markdown code blocks (\`\`\`), if any. This determines the CSS classes that Astro will apply to your Markdown code blocks. * `shiki` - use the [Shiki](https://shiki.style) highlighter (`github-dark` theme configured by default) * `prism` - use the [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) highlighter and [provide your own Prism stylesheet](/en/guides/syntax-highlighting/#add-a-prism-stylesheet) * `false` - do not apply syntax highlighting. ```js { markdown: { // Example: Switch to use prism for syntax highlighting in Markdown syntaxHighlight: 'prism', } } ``` For more control over syntax highlighting, you can instead specify a configuration object with the properties listed below. #### markdown.syntaxHighlight.type [Section titled “markdown.syntaxHighlight.type”](#markdownsyntaxhighlighttype) **Type:** `'shiki' | 'prism'`\ **Default:** `'shiki'` **Added in:** `astro@5.5.0` The default CSS classes to apply to Markdown code blocks. (If no other syntax highlighting configuration is needed, you can instead set `markdown.syntaxHighlight` directly to `shiki`, `prism`, or `false`.) #### markdown.syntaxHighlight.excludeLangs [Section titled “markdown.syntaxHighlight.excludeLangs”](#markdownsyntaxhighlightexcludelangs) **Type:** `Array<string>`\ **Default:** `['math']` **Added in:** `astro@5.5.0` An array of languages to exclude from the default syntax highlighting specified in `markdown.syntaxHighlight.type`. This can be useful when using tools that create diagrams from Markdown code blocks, such as Mermaid.js and D2. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ markdown: { syntaxHighlight: { type: 'shiki', excludeLangs: ['mermaid', 'math'], }, }, }); ``` ### markdown.remarkPlugins [Section titled “markdown.remarkPlugins”](#markdownremarkplugins) **Type:** `RemarkPlugins` Pass [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to customize how your Markdown is built. You can import and apply the plugin function (recommended), or pass the plugin name as a string. ```js import remarkToc from 'remark-toc'; { markdown: { remarkPlugins: [ [remarkToc, { heading: "contents"} ] ] } } ``` ### markdown.rehypePlugins [Section titled “markdown.rehypePlugins”](#markdownrehypeplugins) **Type:** `RehypePlugins` Pass [rehype plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype) to customize how your Markdown’s output HTML is processed. You can import and apply the plugin function (recommended), or pass the plugin name as a string. ```js import { rehypeAccessibleEmojis } from 'rehype-accessible-emojis'; { markdown: { rehypePlugins: [rehypeAccessibleEmojis] } } ``` ### markdown.gfm [Section titled “markdown.gfm”](#markdowngfm) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` Astro uses [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) by default. To disable this, set the `gfm` flag to `false`: ```js { markdown: { gfm: false, } } ``` ### markdown.smartypants [Section titled “markdown.smartypants”](#markdownsmartypants) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` Astro uses the [SmartyPants formatter](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) by default. To disable this, set the `smartypants` flag to `false`: ```js { markdown: { smartypants: false, } } ``` ### markdown.remarkRehype [Section titled “markdown.remarkRehype”](#markdownremarkrehype) **Type:** `RemarkRehype` Pass options to [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype#api). ```js { markdown: { // Example: Translate the footnotes text to another language, here are the default English values remarkRehype: { footnoteLabel: "Footnotes", footnoteBackLabel: "Back to reference 1"}, }, }; ``` ## i18n [Section titled “i18n”](#i18n) **Type:** `object` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` Configures i18n routing and allows you to specify some customization options. See our guide for more information on [internationalization in Astro](/en/guides/internationalization/) ### i18n.locales [Section titled “i18n.locales”](#i18nlocales) **Type:** `Locales` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` A list of all locales supported by the website. This is a required field. Languages can be listed either as individual codes (e.g. `['en', 'es', 'pt-br']`) or mapped to a shared `path` of codes (e.g. `{ path: "english", codes: ["en", "en-US"]}`). These codes will be used to determine the URL structure of your deployed site. No particular language code format or syntax is enforced, but your project folders containing your content files must match exactly the `locales` items in the list. In the case of multiple `codes` pointing to a custom URL path prefix, store your content files in a folder with the same name as the `path` configured. ### i18n.defaultLocale [Section titled “i18n.defaultLocale”](#i18ndefaultlocale) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` The default locale of your website/application, that is one of the specified `locales`. This is a required field. No particular language format or syntax is enforced, but we suggest using lower-case and hyphens as needed (e.g. “es”, “pt-br”) for greatest compatibility. ### i18n.fallback [Section titled “i18n.fallback”](#i18nfallback) **Type:** `Record<string, string>` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` The fallback strategy when navigating to pages that do not exist (e.g. a translated page has not been created). Use this object to declare a fallback `locale` route for each language you support. If no fallback is specified, then unavailable pages will return a 404. ##### Example [Section titled “Example”](#example) The following example configures your content fallback strategy to redirect unavailable pages in `/pt-br/` to their `es` version, and unavailable pages in `/fr/` to their `en` version. Unavailable `/es/` pages will return a 404. ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr", "pt-br", "es"], fallback: { pt: "es", fr: "en" } } }) ``` ### i18n.routing [Section titled “i18n.routing”](#i18nrouting) **Type:** `object | "manual"`\ **Default:** `object` **Added in:** `astro@3.7.0` Controls the routing strategy to determine your site URLs. Set this based on your folder/URL path configuration for your default language. ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr"], routing: { prefixDefaultLocale: false, redirectToDefaultLocale: true, fallbackType: "redirect", } } }) ``` Since 4.6.0, this option can also be set to `manual`. When this routing strategy is enabled, Astro will **disable** its i18n middleware and no other `routing` options (e.g. `prefixDefaultLocale`) may be configured. You will be responsible for writing your own routing logic, or executing Astro’s i18n middleware manually alongside your own. ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr"], routing: "manual" } }) ``` #### i18n.routing.prefixDefaultLocale [Section titled “i18n.routing.prefixDefaultLocale”](#i18nroutingprefixdefaultlocale) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@3.7.0` When `false`, only non-default languages will display a language prefix. The `defaultLocale` will not show a language prefix and content files do not exist in a localized folder. URLs will be of the form `example.com/[locale]/content/` for all non-default languages, but `example.com/content/` for the default locale. When `true`, all URLs will display a language prefix. URLs will be of the form `example.com/[locale]/content/` for every route, including the default language. Localized folders are used for every language, including the default. ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr", "pt-br", "es"], routing: { prefixDefaultLocale: true, } } }) ``` #### i18n.routing.redirectToDefaultLocale [Section titled “i18n.routing.redirectToDefaultLocale”](#i18nroutingredirecttodefaultlocale) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@4.2.0` Configures whether or not the home URL (`/`) generated by `src/pages/index.astro` will redirect to `/[defaultLocale]` when `prefixDefaultLocale: true` is set. Set `redirectToDefaultLocale: false` to disable this automatic redirection at the root of your site: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n:{ defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr"], routing: { prefixDefaultLocale: true, redirectToDefaultLocale: false } } }) ``` #### i18n.routing.fallbackType [Section titled “i18n.routing.fallbackType”](#i18nroutingfallbacktype) **Type:** `"redirect" | "rewrite"`\ **Default:** `"redirect"` **Added in:** `astro@4.15.0` When [`i18n.fallback`](#i18nfallback) is configured to avoid showing a 404 page for missing page routes, this option controls whether to [redirect](/en/guides/routing/#redirects) to the fallback page, or to [rewrite](/en/guides/routing/#rewrites) the fallback page’s content in place. By default, Astro’s i18n routing creates pages that redirect your visitors to a new destination based on your fallback configuration. The browser will refresh and show the destination address in the URL bar. When `i18n.routing.fallback: "rewrite"` is configured, Astro will create pages that render the contents of the fallback page on the original, requested URL. With the following configuration, if you have the file `src/pages/en/about.astro` but not `src/pages/fr/about.astro`, the `astro build` command will generate `dist/fr/about.html` with the same content as the `dist/en/about.html` page. Your site visitor will see the English version of the page at `https://example.com/fr/about/` and will not be redirected. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr"], routing: { prefixDefaultLocale: false, fallbackType: "rewrite", }, fallback: { fr: "en", } }, }) ``` ### i18n.domains [Section titled “i18n.domains”](#i18ndomains) **Type:** `Record<string, string>`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@4.3.0` Configures the URL pattern of one or more supported languages to use a custom domain (or sub-domain). When a locale is mapped to a domain, a `/[locale]/` path prefix will not be used. However, localized folders within `src/pages/` are still required, including for your configured `defaultLocale`. Any other locale not configured will default to a localized path-based URL according to your `prefixDefaultLocale` strategy (e.g. `https://example.com/[locale]/blog`). astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ site: "https://example.com", output: "server", // required, with no prerendered pages adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone', }), i18n: { defaultLocale: "en", locales: ["en", "fr", "pt-br", "es"], prefixDefaultLocale: false, domains: { fr: "https://fr.example.com", es: "https://example.es" } }, }) ``` Both page routes built and URLs returned by the `astro:i18n` helper functions [`getAbsoluteLocaleUrl()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-i18n/#getabsolutelocaleurl) and [`getAbsoluteLocaleUrlList()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-i18n/#getabsolutelocaleurllist) will use the options set in `i18n.domains`. See the [Internationalization Guide](/en/guides/internationalization/#domains) for more details, including the limitations of this feature. ## env [Section titled “env”](#env) **Type:** `object`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Configuration options for type-safe environment variables. See our guide for more information on [environment variables in Astro](/en/guides/environment-variables/). ### env.schema [Section titled “env.schema”](#envschema) **Type:** `EnvSchema`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` An object that uses `envField` to define the data type and properties of your environment variables: `context` (client or server), `access` (public or secret), a `default` value to use, and whether or not this environment variable is `optional` (defaults to `false`). astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, envField } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ env: { schema: { API_URL: envField.string({ context: "client", access: "public", optional: true }), PORT: envField.number({ context: "server", access: "public", default: 4321 }), API_SECRET: envField.string({ context: "server", access: "secret" }), } } }) ``` `envField` supports four data types: string, number, enum, and boolean. `context` and `access` are required properties for all data types. The following shows the complete list of properties available for each data type: ```js import { envField } from "astro/config" envField.string({ // context & access optional: true, default: "foo", max: 20, min: 1, length: 13, url: true, includes: "oo", startsWith: "f", endsWith: "o", }) envField.number({ // context & access optional: true, default: 15, gt: 2, min: 1, lt: 3, max: 4, int: true, }) envField.boolean({ // context & access optional: true, default: true, }) envField.enum({ // context & access values: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], // required optional: true, default: 'baz', }) ``` ### env.validateSecrets [Section titled “env.validateSecrets”](#envvalidatesecrets) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Whether or not to validate secrets on the server when starting the dev server or running a build. By default, only public variables are validated on the server when starting the dev server or a build, and private variables are validated at runtime only. If enabled, private variables will also be checked on start. This is useful in some continuous integration (CI) pipelines to make sure all your secrets are correctly set before deploying. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, envField } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ env: { schema: { // ... }, validateSecrets: true } }) ```

# Astro Container API (experimental)

**Added in:** `astro@4.9.0` The Container API allows you to render Astro components in isolation. This experimental server-side API unlocks a variety of potential future uses, but is currently scoped to allow [testing of `.astro` component output](/en/guides/testing/#vitest-and-container-api) in `vite` environments such as `vitest`. It also allows you to [manually load rendering scripts](#adding-a-renderer-manually) for creating containers in pages rendered on demand or other “shell” environments outside of `vite` (e.g. inside a PHP or Elixir application). This API allows you to [create a new container](#create), and render an Astro component returning [a string](#rendertostring) or a [`Response`](#rendertoresponse). This API is experimental and subject to breaking changes, even in [minor or patch releases](/en/upgrade-astro/#semantic-versioning). Please consult [the Astro CHANGELOG](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for changes as they occur. This page will always be updated with the most current information for the latest version of Astro. ## `create()` [Section titled “create()”](#create) **Type:** `(options?: AstroContainerOptions) => Promise<experimental_AstroContainer>` Creates a new instance of the container. ```js import { experimental_AstroContainer } from "astro/container"; const container = await experimental_AstroContainer.create(); ``` It accepts an object with the following options: ```ts export type AstroContainerOptions = { streaming?: boolean; renderers?: AddServerRenderer[]; }; export type AddServerRenderer = | { renderer: NamedSSRLoadedRendererValue; name: never; } | { renderer: SSRLoadedRendererValue; name: string; }; ``` ### `streaming` option [Section titled “streaming option”](#streaming-option) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` Enables rendering components using [HTML streaming](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#html-streaming). ### `renderers` option [Section titled “renderers option”](#renderers-option) **Type:** `AddServerRenderer[]`\ **Default:** `[]` A list of loaded client renderers required by the component. Use this if your `.astro` component renders any [UI framework components](/en/guides/framework-components/) or MDX using an official Astro integration (e.g. React, Vue, etc.). Renderers can be added through the Container API automatically for static applications, or cases where the container isn’t called at runtime (e.g. testing with `vitest`). For [on-demand rendered applications](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/), or cases where the container is called at runtime or inside other “shells” (e.g. PHP, Ruby, Java, etc.), renderers must be manually imported. #### Adding a renderer through the Container API [Section titled “Adding a renderer through the Container API”](#adding-a-renderer-through-the-container-api) For each official Astro integration, import and use the `getContainerRenderer()` helper function to expose its client and server rendering scripts. These are available for `@astrojs/react`, `@astrojs/preact`, `@astrojs/solid-js`, `@astrojs/svelte`, `@astrojs/vue`, and `@astrojs/mdx`. For renderer packages outside the `@astrojs` npm org, look in their documentation for `getContainerRenderer()` or a similar function provided. When using `vite` (`vitest`, Astro integrations, etc.), the renderers are loaded with the function `loadRenderers()` from the virtual module `astro:container`. Caution Outside `vite` or for on-demand usage, you’ll have to [load the renderers manually](#adding-a-renderer-manually). The following example provides the necessary object to render an Astro component that renders a React component and a Svelte component: ```js import { getContainerRenderer as reactContainerRenderer } from "@astrojs/react"; import { getContainerRenderer as svelteContainerRenderer } from "@astrojs/svelte"; import { loadRenderers } from "astro:container"; const renderers = await loadRenderers([reactContainerRenderer(), svelteContainerRenderer()]); const container = await experimental_AstroContainer.create({ renderers }) const result = await container.renderToString(ReactWrapper); ``` #### Adding a renderer manually [Section titled “Adding a renderer manually”](#adding-a-renderer-manually) When the container is called at runtime, or inside other “shells”, the `astro:container` virtual module’s helper functions are not available. You must import the necessary server and client renderers manually and store them inside the container using `addServerRenderer` and `addClientRenderer`. Server renderers are required to build your project, and must be stored in the container for every framework used. Client renderers are additionally needed to any hydrate client-side components using [`client:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives). Only one import statement is needed per framework. Importing a renderer makes both the server and client renderers available to your container. However, **server renderers must be added to your container before client renderers**. This allows your entire container to render first, and then hydrate any interactive components. The following example manually imports the necessary server renderers to be able to display static Vue components and `.mdx` pages. It additionally adds both server and client renderers for interactive React components. ```js import reactRenderer from "@astrojs/react/server.js"; import vueRenderer from "@astrojs/vue/server.js"; import mdxRenderer from "@astrojs/mdx/server.js"; const container = await experimental_AstroContainer.create(); container.addServerRenderer({ renderer: vueRenderer }); container.addServerRenderer({ renderer: mdxRenderer }); container.addServerRenderer({ renderer: reactRenderer }); container.addClientRenderer({ name: "@astrojs/react", entrypoint: "@astrojs/react/client.js" }); ``` ## `renderToString()` [Section titled “renderToString()”](#rendertostring) **Type:** `(component: AstroComponentFactory; options?: ContainerRenderOptions) => Promise<string>` This function renders a specified component inside a container. It takes an Astro component as an argument and it returns a string that represents the HTML/content rendered by the Astro component. ```js import { experimental_AstroContainer } from "astro/container"; import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; const container = await experimental_AstroContainer.create(); const result = await container.renderToString(Card); ``` Under the hood, this function calls [`renderToResponse()`](#rendertoresponse) and `Response.text()`. It also accepts an object as a second argument that can contain a [number of options](#rendering-options). ## `renderToResponse()` [Section titled “renderToResponse()”](#rendertoresponse) **Type:** `(component: AstroComponentFactory; options?: ContainerRenderOptions) => Promise<Response>` It renders a component, and it returns a `Response` object. ```js import { experimental_AstroContainer } from "astro/container"; import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; const container = await experimental_AstroContainer.create(); const result = await container.renderToResponse(Card); ``` It also accepts an object as a second argument that can contain a [number of options](#rendering-options). ## Rendering options [Section titled “Rendering options”](#rendering-options) Both [`renderToResponse()`](#rendertoresponse) and [`renderToString()`](#rendertostring) accept an object as their second argument: ```ts export type ContainerRenderOptions = { slots?: Record<string, any>; props?: Record<string, unknown>; request?: Request; params?: Record<string, string | undefined>; locals?: App.Locals; routeType?: RouteType; partial?: boolean; }; ``` These optional values can be passed to the rendering function in order to provide additional information necessary for an Astro component to properly render. ### `slots` [Section titled “slots”](#slots) **Type**: `Record<string, any>` An option to pass content to be rendered with [`<slots>`](/en/basics/astro-components/#slots). If your Astro component renders one default slot, pass an object with `default` as the key: ```js import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { slots: { default: "Some value" } }); ``` If your component renders named slots, use the slot names as the object keys: ```astro --- --- <div> <slot name="header" /> <slot name="footer" /> </div> ``` ```js import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { slots: { header: "Header content", footer: "Footer" } }); ``` You can also render components in cascade: ```astro --- --- <div> <slot name="header" /> <slot name="footer" /> </div> ``` ```js import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; import CardHeader from "../src/components/CardHeader.astro"; import CardFooter from "../src/components/CardFooter.astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { slots: { header: await container.renderToString(CardHeader), footer: await container.renderToString(CardFooter) } }); ``` ### `props` option [Section titled “props option”](#props-option) **Type**: `Record<string, unknown>` An option to pass [properties](/en/basics/astro-components/#component-props) for Astro components. ```js import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { props: { name: "Hello, world!" } }); ``` ```astro --- // For TypeScript support interface Props { name: string; }; const { name } = Astro.props; --- <div> {name} </div> ``` ### `request` option [Section titled “request option”](#request-option) **Type**: `Request` An option to pass a `Request` with information about the path/URL the component will render. Use this option when your component needs to read information like `Astro.url` or `Astro.request`. You can also inject possible headers or cookies. ```js import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { request: new Request("https://example.com/blog", { headers: { "x-some-secret-header": "test-value" } }) }); ``` ### `params` option [Section titled “params option”](#params-option) **Type**: `Record<string, string | undefined>` An object to pass information about the path parameter to an Astro component responsible for [generating dynamic routes](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes). Use this option when your component needs a value for `Astro.params` in order to generate a single route dynamically. ```astro --- const { locale, slug } = Astro.params; --- <div></div> ``` ```js import LocaleSlug from "../src/components/[locale]/[slug].astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(LocaleSlug, { params: { locale: "en", slug: "getting-started" } }); ``` ### `locals` options [Section titled “locals options”](#locals-options) **Type**: `App.Locals` An option to pass information from [`Astro.locals`](/en/reference/api-reference/#locals) for rendering your component. Use this option to when your component needs information stored during the lifecycle of a request in order to render, such as logged in status. ```astro --- const { checkAuth } = Astro.locals; const isAuthenticated = checkAuth(); --- {isAuthenticated ? <span>You're in</span> : <span>You're out</span> } ``` ```js import Card from "../src/components/Card.astro"; test("User is in", async () => { const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { locals: { checkAuth() { return true; } } }); // assert result contains "You're in" }); test("User is out", async () => { const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { locals: { checkAuth() { return false; } } }); // assert result contains "You're out" }); ``` ### `routeType` option [Section titled “routeType option”](#routetype-option) **Type**: `RouteType` An option available when using `renderToResponse()` to specify that you are rendering an [endpoint](/en/guides/endpoints/): ```js container.renderToString(Endpoint, { routeType: "endpoint" }); ``` ```js import * as Endpoint from "../src/pages/api/endpoint.js"; const response = await container.renderToResponse(Endpoint, { routeType: "endpoint" }); const json = await response.json(); ``` To test your endpoint on methods such as `POST`, `PATCH`, etc., use the `request` option to call the correct function: ```js export function GET() {} // need to test this export function POST() {} ``` ```diff import * as Endpoint from "../src/pages/api/endpoint.js"; const response = await container.renderToResponse(Endpoint, { routeType: "endpoint", request: new Request("https://example.com", { method: "POST" // Specify POST method for testing }) }); const json = await response.json(); ``` ### `partial` option [Section titled “partial option”](#partial-option) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@4.16.6` Whether or not the Container API renders components as if they were [page partials](/en/basics/astro-pages/#page-partials). The default `true` setting renders the component in isolation without a full page shell. To render a component as a full Astro page, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, you can opt-out of this behavior by setting `partial` to `false`: ```diff import Blog from "../src/pages/Blog.astro"; const result = await container.renderToString(Card, { partial: false }); console.log(result) // includes `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the beginning of the HTML ```

# Astro Content Loader API

Astro’s Content Loader API allows you to load your data from any source, local or remote, and interact with Astro’s content layer to manage your [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/). ## What is a loader? [Section titled “What is a loader?”](#what-is-a-loader) Astro loaders allow you to load data into [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/), which can then be used in pages and components. The [built-in `glob()` and `file()` loaders](/en/guides/content-collections/#built-in-loaders) are used to load content from the file system, and you can create your own loaders to load content from other sources. Each collection needs [a loader defined in its schema](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-the-collection-loader). You can define a loader inline in your project’s `src/content.config.ts` file, share one loader between multiple collections, or even [publish your loader to NPM as a package](/en/reference/publish-to-npm/) to share with others and be included in our integrations library. ## Built-in loaders [Section titled “Built-in loaders”](#built-in-loaders) Astro provides two built-in loaders to help you fetch your collections. Both offer options to suit a wide range of use cases. ### `glob()` loader [Section titled “glob() loader”](#glob-loader) **Type:** `(options: GlobOptions) => Loader` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The `glob()` loader creates entries from directories of files from anywhere on the filesystem. The supported file types are Markdown, MDX, Markdoc, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. This loader accepts an object with the following properties: `pattern`, `base` (optional), `generateId` (optional), and `retainBody` (optional). src/content.config.ts ```ts import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { glob } from 'astro/loaders'; const pages = defineCollection({ /* Retrieve all Markdown files in your pages directory. */ loader: glob({ pattern: "**/*.md", base: "./src/data/pages" }), schema: /* ... */ }); const blog = defineCollection({ /* Retrieve all Markdown and MDX files in your blog directory. */ loader: glob({ pattern: "**/*.(md|mdx)", base: "./src/data/blog" }), schema: /* ... */ }); const notes = defineCollection({ /* Retrieve all Markdown files in your notes directory and prevent * the raw body of content files from being stored in the data store. */ loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md', base: './src/data/notes', retainBody: false }), schema: /* ... */ }); const authors = defineCollection({ /* Retrieve all JSON files in your authors directory while retaining * uppercase letters in the ID. */ loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.json', base: "./src/data/authors", generateId: ({ entry }) => entry.replace(/\.json$/, ''), }), schema: /* ... */ }); ``` #### `pattern` [Section titled “pattern”](#pattern) **Type:** `string | string[]` The `pattern` property accepts a string or an array of strings using glob matching (e.g. wildcards, globstars). The patterns must be relative to the base directory of entry files to match. You can learn more about the syntax to use in the [micromatch documentation](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features). You can also verify the validity of your pattern using an online tool like the [DigitalOcean Glob Tool](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob). #### `base` [Section titled “base”](#base) **Type:** `string | URL`\ **Default:** `"."` A relative path or [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) to the directory from which to resolve the `pattern`. #### `generateId()` [Section titled “generateId()”](#generateid) **Type:** `(options: GenerateIdOptions) => string` A callback function that returns a unique string per entry in a collection. It accepts an object as parameter with the following properties: * `entry` - the path to the entry file, relative to the base directory * `base` - the base directory [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) * `data` - the parsed, unvalidated data of the entry By default it uses [`github-slugger`](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger) to generate a slug with [kebab-cased](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case) words. #### `retainBody` [Section titled “retainBody”](#retainbody) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@5.17.0` New Whether or not to store the raw body of content files in the data store. When `retainBody` is `false`, [`entry.body`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#body) will be `undefined` instead of containing the raw file contents. Setting this property to `false` significantly reduces the deployed size of the data store and helps avoid hitting size limits for sites with very large collections. For Markdown files, the rendered body will still be available in the [`entry.rendered.html` property](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#rendered), and the [`entry.filePath` property](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#filepath) will still point to the original file. For MDX collections, this will dramatically reduce the size of the collection, as there will no longer be any body retained in the store. ### `file()` loader [Section titled “file() loader”](#file-loader) **Type:** `(fileName: string, options?: FileOptions) => Loader` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The `file()` loader creates entries from a single file that contains an array of objects with a unique `id` field, or an object with IDs as keys and entries as values. It supports JSON, YAML, or TOML files and you can provide a custom `parser` for data files it cannot parse by default. This loader accepts a `fileName` property and an optional object as second argument: src/content.config.ts ```ts import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { file } from 'astro/loaders'; const authors = defineCollection({ /* Retrieve all entries from a JSON file. */ loader: file("src/data/authors.json"), schema: /* ... */ }); const products = defineCollection({ /* Retrieve all entries from a CSV file using a custom parser. */ loader: file("src/data/products.csv", { parser: (fileContent) => { /* your parser logic */ }, }), schema: /* ... */ }); ``` #### `fileName` [Section titled “fileName”](#filename) **Type:** `string` Sets the path to the file to load, relative to the root directory. #### Options [Section titled “Options”](#options) **Type:** `FileOptions` An optional object with the following properties: ##### `parser()` [Section titled “parser()”](#parser) **Type:** `(text: string) => Record<string, Record<string, unknown>> | Array<Record<string, unknown>> | Promise<Record<string, Record<string, unknown>> | Array<Record<string, unknown>>>` A callback function to create a collection from a file’s contents. Use it when you need to process file not supported by default (e.g. `.csv`) or when using [nested `.json` documents](/en/guides/content-collections/#nested-json-documents). ## Loader types [Section titled “Loader types”](#loader-types) Loaders can be defined either as a simple function that returns an array of entries or with the more powerful object Content Loader API for more control over the loading process. ### Inline loaders [Section titled “Inline loaders”](#inline-loaders) An inline loader is an async function that returns an array or object containing entries. Use this for simple loaders, particularly those that are defined inline in the `src/content.config.ts` file. The function can be async and must return either an array of entries that each contain a unique `id` field, or an object where each key is a unique ID and each value is the entry. Whenever the loader is invoked, it will clear the store and reload all the entries. src/content.config.ts ```ts const countries = defineCollection({ loader: async () => { const response = await fetch("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all"); const data = await response.json(); // Must return an array of entries with an id property // or an object with IDs as keys and entries as values return data.map((country) => ({ id: country.cca3, ...country, })); }, schema: /* ... */ }); ``` ### Object loaders [Section titled “Object loaders”](#object-loaders) A loader is an object with a `load()` method that is called at build time to fetch data and update the data store. It allows entries to be updated incrementally, or for the store to be cleared only when necessary. It can also define a schema for the entries, which can be used to validate the data and generate static types. The recommended pattern is to define a function that accepts configuration options and returns the loader object, in the same way that you would normally define an Astro integration or Vite plugin. loader.ts ```ts import type { Loader, LoaderContext } from 'astro/loaders'; import { z } from 'astro/zod'; import { loadFeedData } from "./feed.js"; // Define any options that the loader needs export function myLoader(options: { url: string, apiKey: string }): Loader { // Configure the loader const feedUrl = new URL(options.url); // Return a loader object return { name: "my-loader", // Called when updating the collection. load: async (context: LoaderContext): Promise<void> => { // Load data and update the store const response = await loadFeedData(feedUrl, options.apiKey); }, // Optionally, define the schema of an entry. // It will be overridden by user-defined schema. schema: async () => z.object({ // ... }) }; } ``` These configuration options can then be set when defining a collection: src/content.config.ts ```ts import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { z } from 'astro/zod'; import myLoader from '../../loader.ts'; const blog = defineCollection({ loader: myLoader({ url: "https://api.example.com/posts", apiKey: "my-secret", }), schema: /* ... */ }); ``` ## Object loader API [Section titled “Object loader API”](#object-loader-api) The API for [inline loaders](#inline-loaders) is very simple, and is shown above. This section shows the API for defining an object loader. ### The `Loader` object [Section titled “The Loader object”](#the-loader-object) The loader object has the following properties: #### `name` [Section titled “name”](#name) **Type**: `string` A unique name for the loader, used in logs and [for conditional loading](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#refreshcontent-option). #### `load` [Section titled “load”](#load) **Type**: `(context: LoaderContext) => Promise<void>` An async function that is called at build time to load data and update the store. See [`LoaderContext`](#loadercontext) for more information. #### `schema` [Section titled “schema”](#schema) **Type**: `ZodSchema | Promise<ZodSchema> | (() => ZodSchema | Promise<ZodSchema>)` An optional [Zod schema](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-datatypes-with-zod) that defines the shape of the entries. It is used to both validate the data and also to generate TypeScript types for the collection. If a function is provided, it will be called at build time before `load()` to generate the schema. You can use this to dynamically generate the schema based on the configuration options or by introspecting an API. ### `LoaderContext` [Section titled “LoaderContext”](#loadercontext) This object is passed to the `load()` method of the loader, and contains the following properties: #### `collection` [Section titled “collection”](#collection) **Type**: `string` The unique name of the collection. This is the key in the `collections` object in the `src/content.config.ts` file. #### `store` [Section titled “store”](#store) **Type**: [`DataStore`](#datastore) A database to store the actual data. Use this to update the store with new entries. See [`DataStore`](#datastore) for more information. #### `meta` [Section titled “meta”](#meta) **Type**: `MetaStore` A key-value store scoped to the collection, designed for things like sync tokens and last-modified times. This metadata is persisted between builds alongside the collection data but is only available inside the loader. ```ts const lastModified = meta.get("lastModified"); // ... meta.set("lastModified", new Date().toISOString()); ``` #### `logger` [Section titled “logger”](#logger) **Type**: [`AstroIntegrationLogger`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astrointegrationlogger) A logger that can be used to log messages to the console. Use this instead of `console.log` for more helpful logs that include the loader name in the log message. See [`AstroIntegrationLogger`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astrointegrationlogger) for more information. #### `config` [Section titled “config”](#config) **Type**: `AstroConfig` The full, resolved Astro configuration object with all defaults applied. See [the configuration reference](/en/reference/configuration-reference/) for more information. #### `parseData` [Section titled “parseData”](#parsedata) **Type**: `(props: ParseDataOptions<TData>) => Promise<TData>` Validates and parses the data according to the collection schema. Pass data to this function to validate and parse it before storing it in the data store. loader.ts ```ts import type { Loader } from "astro/loaders"; import { loadFeed } from "./feed.js"; export function feedLoader({ url }): Loader { const feedUrl = new URL(url); return { name: "feed-loader", load: async ({ store, logger, parseData, meta, generateDigest }) => { logger.info("Loading posts"); const feed = loadFeed(feedUrl); store.clear(); for (const item of feed.items) { const data = await parseData({ id: item.guid, data: item, }); store.set({ id, data, }); } }, }; } ``` #### `renderMarkdown` [Section titled “renderMarkdown”](#rendermarkdown) **Type**: `(markdown: string) => Promise<RenderedContent>` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Renders a Markdown string to HTML, returning a `RenderedContent` object. This allows you to render Markdown content directly within your loaders using the same Markdown processing as Astro’s built-in `glob` loader and provides access to the `render()` function and `<Content />` component for [rendering body content](/en/guides/content-collections/#rendering-body-content). Assign this object to the [rendered](#rendered) field of the [DataEntry](#dataentry) object to allow users to [render the content in a page](/en/guides/content-collections/#rendering-body-content). loader.ts ```ts import type { Loader } from 'astro/loaders'; import { loadFromCMS } from './cms.js'; export function myLoader(settings): Loader { return { name: 'cms-loader', async load({ renderMarkdown, store }) { const entries = await loadFromCMS(); store.clear(); for (const entry of entries) { store.set({ id: entry.id, data: entry, // Assume each entry has a 'content' field with markdown content rendered: await renderMarkdown(entry.content), }); } }, }; } ``` #### `generateDigest` [Section titled “generateDigest”](#generatedigest) **Type**: `(data: Record<string, unknown> | string) => string` Generates a non-cryptographic content digest of an object or string. This can be used to track if the data has changed by setting [the `digest` field](#digest) of an entry. loader.ts ```ts import type { Loader } from "astro/loaders"; import { loadFeed } from "./feed.js"; export function feedLoader({ url }): Loader { const feedUrl = new URL(url); return { name: "feed-loader", load: async ({ store, logger, parseData, meta, generateDigest }) => { logger.info("Loading posts"); const feed = loadFeed(feedUrl); store.clear(); for (const item of feed.items) { const data = await parseData({ id: item.guid, data: item, }); const digest = generateDigest(data); store.set({ id, data, digest, }); } }, }; } ``` #### `watcher` [Section titled “watcher”](#watcher) **Type**: `FSWatcher` When running in dev mode, this is a filesystem watcher that can be used to trigger updates. See [`ViteDevServer`](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#vitedevserver) for more information. Extract from the file() loader ```ts return { name: 'file-loader', load: async ({ config, store, watcher }) => { const url = new URL(fileName, config.root); const filePath = fileURLToPath(url); await syncData(filePath, store); watcher?.on('change', async (changedPath) => { if (changedPath === filePath) { logger.info(`Reloading data from ${fileName}`); await syncData(filePath, store); } }); }, }; ``` #### `refreshContextData` [Section titled “refreshContextData”](#refreshcontextdata) **Type**: `Record<string, unknown>` If the loader has been triggered by an integration, this may optionally contain extra data set by that integration. It is only set when the loader is triggered by an integration. See the [`astro:server:setup`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#refreshcontent-option) hook reference for more information. loader.ts ```ts export function myLoader(options: { url: string }): Loader { return { name: "my-loader", load: async ({ refreshContextData, store, logger }) => { if(refreshContextData?.webhookBody) { logger.info("Webhook triggered with body"); processWebhook(store, refreshContextData.webhookBody); } // ... }, }; } ``` ### `DataStore` [Section titled “DataStore”](#datastore) The data store is a loader’s interface to the content collection data. It is a key-value (KV) store, scoped to the collection, and therefore a loader can only access the data for its own collection. #### `get` [Section titled “get”](#get) **Type**: `(key: string) => DataEntry | undefined` Get an entry from the store by its ID. Returns `undefined` if the entry does not exist. ```ts const existingEntry = store.get("my-entry"); ``` The returned object is a [`DataEntry`](#dataentry) object. #### `set` [Section titled “set”](#set) **Type**: `(entry: DataEntry) => boolean` Used after data has been [validated and parsed](#parsedata) to add an entry to the store, returning `true` if the entry was set. This returns `false` when the [`digest`](#digest) property determines that an entry has not changed and should not be updated. loader.ts ```ts for (const item of feed.items) { const data = await parseData({ id: item.guid, data: item, }); const digest = generateDigest(data); store.set({ id, data, rendered: { html: data.description ?? "", }, digest, }); } ``` #### `entries` [Section titled “entries”](#entries) **Type**: `() => Array<[id: string, DataEntry]>` Get all entries in the collection as an array of key-value pairs. #### `keys` [Section titled “keys”](#keys) **Type**: `() => Array<string>` Get all the keys of the entries in the collection. #### `values` [Section titled “values”](#values) **Type**: `() => Array<DataEntry>` Get all entries in the collection as an array. #### `delete` [Section titled “delete”](#delete) **Type**: `(key: string) => void` Delete an entry from the store by its ID. #### `clear` [Section titled “clear”](#clear) **Type**: `() => void` Clear all entries from the collection. #### `has` [Section titled “has”](#has) **Type**: `(key: string) => boolean` Check if an entry exists in the store by its ID. ### `DataEntry` [Section titled “DataEntry”](#dataentry) This is the type of the object that is stored in the data store. It has the following properties: #### `id` [Section titled “id”](#id) **Type**: `string` An identifier for the entry, which must be unique within the collection. This is used to look up the entry in the store and is the key used with `getEntry` for that collection. #### `data` [Section titled “data”](#data) **Type**: `Record<string, unknown>` The actual data for the entry. When a user accesses the collection, this will have TypeScript types generated according to the collection schema. It is the loader’s responsibility to use [`parseData`](#parsedata) to validate and parse the data before storing it in the data store: no validation is done when getting or setting the data. #### `filePath` [Section titled “filePath”](#filepath) **Type**: `string | undefined` A path to the file that is the source of this entry, relative to the root of the site. This only applies to file-based loaders and is used to resolve paths such as images or other assets. If not set, then any fields in the schema that use [the `image()` helper](/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections) will be treated as [public paths](/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images) and not transformed. #### `body` [Section titled “body”](#body) **Type**: `string | undefined` The raw body of the entry, if applicable. If the entry includes [rendered content](#rendered), then this field can be used to store the raw source. This is optional and is not used internally. #### `digest` [Section titled “digest”](#digest) **Type**: `string | undefined` An optional content digest for the entry. This can be used to check if the data has changed. When [setting an entry](#set), the entry will only update if the digest does not match an existing entry with the same ID. The format of the digest is up to the loader, but it must be a string that changes when the data changes. This can be done with the [`generateDigest`](#generatedigest) function. #### `rendered` [Section titled “rendered”](#rendered) **Type**: `RenderedContent | undefined` Stores an object with an entry’s rendered content and metadata if it has been rendered to HTML. For example, this can be used to store the rendered content of a Markdown entry, or HTML from a CMS. If this field is provided, then [the `render()` function and `<Content />` component](/en/guides/content-collections/#rendering-body-content) are available to render the entry in a page. The format of the `RenderedContent` object is: ```ts { /** Rendered HTML string. If present then `render(entry)` will return a component that renders this HTML. */ html: string; metadata?: { /** Any images that are present in this entry. Relative to the DataEntry filePath. */ imagePaths?: Array<string>; /** Any headings that are present in this file. Returned as `headings` from `render()` */ headings?: MarkdownHeading[]; /** Raw frontmatter, parsed from the file. This may include data from remark plugins. */ frontmatter?: Record<string, any>; /** Any other metadata that is present in this file. */ [key: string]: unknown; }; } ``` If the entry has Markdown content then you can use the [`renderMarkdown()`](#rendermarkdown) function to generate this object from the Markdown string.

# Dev Toolbar App API

The Astro Dev Toolbar App API allows you to create [Astro Integrations](/en/reference/integrations-reference/) that add apps to the Astro Dev Toolbar. This allows you to add new features and integrations with third-party services. ![](/houston_chef.webp) **Related recipe:** [Create a dev toolbar app](/en/recipes/making-toolbar-apps/) ## Toolbar app integration setup [Section titled “Toolbar app integration setup”](#toolbar-app-integration-setup) Integrations can add apps to the dev toolbar in [the `astro:config:setup` hook](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astroconfigsetup). my-integration.js ```ts /** * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration} */ export default () => ({ name: "my-integration", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addDevToolbarApp }) => { addDevToolbarApp({ id: "my-app", name: "My App", icon: "<svg>...</svg>", entrypoint: "./my-app.js", }); }, }, }); ``` ### `addDevToolbarApp()` [Section titled “addDevToolbarApp()”](#adddevtoolbarapp) **Type:** `(entrypoint: DevToolbarAppEntry) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` A function available to [the `astro:config:setup` hook](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astroconfigsetup) that adds dev toolbar apps. It takes an object with the following required properties to define the toolbar app: [`id`](#id), [`name`](#name), and [`entrypoint`](#entrypoint). Optionally, you can also define an [`icon`](#icon) for your app. ### `id` [Section titled “id”](#id) **Type:** `string` A unique identifier for the app. This will be used to uniquely identify the app in hooks and events. my-integration.js ```ts { id: 'my-app', // ... } ``` ### `name` [Section titled “name”](#name) **Type:** `string` The name of the app. This will be shown to users whenever the app needs to be referenced using a human-readable name. my-integration.js ```ts { // ... name: 'My App', // ... } ``` ### `icon` [Section titled “icon”](#icon) **Type:** `Icon | string`\ **Default**: `"?"` The icon used to display the app in the toolbar. This can either be an icon from [the icon list](#icons), or a string containing the SVG markup of the icon. my-integration.js ```ts { // ... icon: '<svg>...</svg>', // or, e.g. 'astro:logo' // ... } ``` ### `entrypoint` [Section titled “entrypoint”](#entrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` The path to the file that exports the dev toolbar app. my-integration.js ```ts { // ... entrypoint: './my-app.js', } ``` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The function also accepts a `URL` as `entrypoint`: my-integration.js ```ts /** * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration} */ export default () => ({ name: "my-integration", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addDevToolbarApp }) => { addDevToolbarApp({ id: "my-app", name: "My App", icon: "<svg>...</svg>", entrypoint: new URL("./my-app.js", import.meta.url), }); }, }, }); ``` ## Structure of a Dev Toolbar App [Section titled “Structure of a Dev Toolbar App”](#structure-of-a-dev-toolbar-app) A Dev Toolbar App is a `.js` or `.ts` file that default exports an object using the [`defineToolbarApp()` function](#definetoolbarapp) available from the `astro/toolbar` module. src/my-app.js ```ts import { defineToolbarApp } from "astro/toolbar"; export default defineToolbarApp({ init(canvas) { const text = document.createTextNode('Hello World!'); canvas.appendChild(text); }, beforeTogglingOff() { const confirmation = window.confirm('Really exit?'); return confirmation; } }); ``` ### `defineToolbarApp()` [Section titled “defineToolbarApp()”](#definetoolbarapp) **Type:** `(app: DevToolbarApp) => DevToolbarApp` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` A function that defines the logic of your toolbar app when it is loaded and toggled off. This function takes an object with an [`init()`](#init) function that will be called when the dev toolbar app is loaded. It can also take a [`beforeTogglingOff()`](#beforetogglingoff) function that will run when the toolbar app is clicked to toggle off its active status. ### `init()` [Section titled “init()”](#init) **Type:** `(canvas: ShadowRoot, app: ToolbarAppEventTarget, server: ToolbarServerHelpers) => void | Promise<void>` Although not required, most apps will use this function to define the core behavior of the app. This function will be called only once when the app is loaded, which will either be when the browser is idle or when the user clicks on the app in the UI, depending on which one comes first. The function receives three arguments to define your app logic: [`canvas`](#canvas) (to render elements to the screen), [`app`](#app) (to send and receive client-side events from the dev toolbar), and [`server`](#server) (to communicate with the server). #### `canvas` [Section titled “canvas”](#canvas) **Type:** `ShadowRoot` A standard [ShadowRoot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) that the app can use to render its UI. Elements can be created and added to the ShadowRoot using the standard DOM APIs. Every app receives its own dedicated ShadowRoot for rendering its UI. Additionally, the parent element is positioned using `position: absolute;` so the app UI will not affect the layout of an Astro page. src/my-app.js ```ts export default defineToolbarApp({ init(canvas) { canvas.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Hello World!')) } }); ``` #### `app` [Section titled “app”](#app) **Type:** `ToolbarAppEventTarget` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` A standard [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) with a few additional [helpers for client-side events](#client-side-events) that can be used to send and receive events from the Dev toolbar. src/my-app.js ```ts export default defineToolbarApp({ init(canvas, app) { app.onToggled(({ state }) => { const text = document.createTextNode( `The app is now ${state ? "enabled" : "disabled"}!`, ); canvas.appendChild(text); }); }, }); ``` #### `server` [Section titled “server”](#server) **Type:** `ToolbarServerHelpers` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` An object that can be used to [communicate with the server](#client-server-communication). src/my-app.js ```ts export default defineToolbarApp({ init(canvas, app, server) { server.send('my-message', { message: 'Hello!' }); server.on('server-message', (data) => { console.log(data.message); }); }, }); ``` ### `beforeTogglingOff()` [Section titled “beforeTogglingOff()”](#beforetogglingoff) **Type:** `(canvas: ShadowRoot) => boolean | Promise<boolean>` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` This optional function will be called when the user clicks on the app icon in the UI to toggle off the app. This function can be used, for example, to perform cleanup operations, or to ask the user for confirmation before toggling off the app. If a falsy value is returned, the toggling off will be cancelled and the app will stay enabled. src/my-app.js ```ts export default defineToolbarApp({ // ... beforeTogglingOff() { const confirmation = window.confirm('Are you sure you want to disable this app?'); return confirmation; } }); ``` #### canvas [Section titled “canvas”](#canvas-1) **Type:** `ShadowRoot` The ShadowRoot of the app, can be used to render any UI needed before closing. Same as the [`canvas` argument of the `init` function](#canvas). ## Client-side Events [Section titled “Client-side Events”](#client-side-events) In addition to the standard methods of an `EventTarget` ([`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget), [`dispatchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent), [`removeEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)etc.), the [`app`](#app) object also has the following methods: ### `onToggled()` [Section titled “onToggled()”](#ontoggled) **Type:** `(callback: (options: {state: boolean})) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Registers a callback to be called when the user clicks on the app icon in the UI to toggle the app on or off. src/my-app.js ```ts app.onToggled((options) => { console.log(`The app is now ${options.state ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}!`); }); ``` ### `onToolbarPlacementUpdated()` [Section titled “onToolbarPlacementUpdated()”](#ontoolbarplacementupdated) **Type:** `(callback: (options: {placement: 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-center' | 'bottom-right'})) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` This event is fired when the user changes the placement of the Dev Toolbar. This can, for example, be used to reposition the app’s UI when the toolbar is moved. src/my-app.js ```ts app.onToolbarPlacementUpdated((options) => { console.log(`The toolbar is now placed at ${options.placement}!`); }); ``` ### `toggleState()` [Section titled “toggleState()”](#togglestate) **Type:** `(options: {state: boolean}) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Changes the state of the app. This can be used to enable or disable the app programmatically, for example, when the user clicks on a button in the app’s UI. src/my-app.js ```ts app.toggleState({ state: false }); ``` ### `toggleNotification()` [Section titled “toggleNotification()”](#togglenotification) **Type:** `(options: {state?: boolean, level?: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'}) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Toggles a notification on the app icon. This can be used to inform the user that the app requires attention, or remove the current notification. src/my-app.js ```ts app.toggleNotification({ state: true, level: 'warning', }); ``` #### `state` [Section titled “state”](#state) **Type:** `boolean` Indicates whether or not the app has a notification for the user. When `true`, the app icon will be highlighted. Conversely, when `false`, the highlight will be removed. If this property is not specified, `true` will be assumed. #### `level` [Section titled “level”](#level) **Type:** `'error' | 'warning' | 'info'`\ **Default:** `'error'` Indicates the level of the notification. This will be used to determine the color and shape (dark pink circle, gold triangle, or blue square) of the highlight on the app icon. If this property is not specified, `'error'` will be assumed. ## Client-Server Communication [Section titled “Client-Server Communication”](#client-server-communication) Using [Vite’s methods for client-server communication](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#client-server-communication), Dev Toolbar Apps and the server can communicate with each other. In order to facilitate sending and receiving custom messages, helper methods are provided for use both in your toolbar app (on the client) and in your integration (on the server). ### On the client [Section titled “On the client”](#on-the-client) In your app, use the [`server` object on the `init()` hook](#server) to send and receive messages to and from the server. src/my-app.js ```ts export default defineToolbarApp({ init(canvas, app, server) { server.send('my-message', { message: 'Hello!' }); server.on('server-message', (data) => { console.log(data.message); }); }, }); ``` #### `send()` [Section titled “send()”](#send) **Type:** `<T>(event: string, payload: T) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Sends data to the server from logic defined in your toolbar app. src/my-app.js ```ts init(canvas, app, server) { server.send('my-app:my-message', { message: 'Hello!' }); } ``` When sending messages from the client to the server, it is good practice to prefix the event name with the app ID or other namespaces to avoid conflicts with other apps or other integrations that may be listening for messages. #### `on()` [Section titled “on()”](#on) **Type:** `<T>(event: string, callback: (data: T) => void) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Registers a callback to be called when the server sends a message with the specified event. src/my-app.js ```ts init(canvas, app, server) { server.on('server-message', (data) => { console.log(data.message); }); } ``` ### On the server [Section titled “On the server”](#on-the-server) In an integration, such as [the integration that adds your toolbar app](#toolbar-app-integration-setup), use the [`astro:server:setup` hook](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astroserversetup) to access the `toolbar` object to send and receive messages to and from your apps. my-integration.js ```ts export default () => ({ name: "my-integration", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addDevToolbarApp }) => {}, "astro:server:setup": ({ toolbar }) => {}, }, }); ``` #### `send()` [Section titled “send()”](#send-1) **Type:** `<T>(event: string, payload: T) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Sends data to the client. my-integration.js ```ts 'astro:server:setup': ({ toolbar }) => { toolbar.send('server-message', { message: 'Hello!' }); }, ``` #### `on()` [Section titled “on()”](#on-1) **Type:** `<T>(event: string, callback: (data: T) => void) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Registers a callback to be called when the client sends a message with the specified event. my-integration.js ```ts 'astro:server:setup': ({ toolbar }) => { toolbar.on('my-app:my-message', (data) => { console.log(data.message); }); }, ``` #### `onAppInitialized()` [Section titled “onAppInitialized()”](#onappinitialized) **Type:** `(appId: string, callback: () => void) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Registers a callback to be called when the app is initialized. my-integration.js ```ts 'astro:server:setup': ({ toolbar }) => { toolbar.onAppInitialized('my-app', () => { console.log('The app is now initialized!'); }); }, ``` #### `onAppToggled()` [Section titled “onAppToggled()”](#onapptoggled) **Type:** `(appId: string, callback: (options: {state: boolean}) => void) => void` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` Registers a callback to be called when the user clicks on the app icon in the UI to toggle the app on or off. my-integration.js ```ts 'astro:server:setup': ({ toolbar }) => { toolbar.onAppToggled('my-app', ({ state }) => { console.log(`The app is now ${state ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}!`); }); }, ``` ## Component Library [Section titled “Component Library”](#component-library) The Dev Toolbar includes a set of web components that can be used to build apps with a consistent look and feel. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-window` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-window”](#astro-dev-toolbar-window) Shows a window. The slot of the component will be used as the content of the window. ```html <astro-dev-toolbar-window> <p>My content</p> </astro-dev-toolbar-window> ``` When building a window using JavaScript, slotted content must go inside the light DOM of the component. ```js const myWindow = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-window'); const myContent = document.createElement('p'); myContent.textContent = 'My content'; // use appendChild directly on `window`, not `myWindow.shadowRoot` myWindow.appendChild(myContent); ``` ### `astro-dev-toolbar-button` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-button”](#astro-dev-toolbar-button) Shows a button. The slot of the component will be used as the content of the button. ```js const myButton = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-button'); myButton.textContent = 'Click me!'; myButton.buttonStyle = "purple"; myButton.size = "medium"; myButton.addEventListener('click', () => { console.log('Clicked!'); }); ``` #### `size` [Section titled “size”](#size) **Type:** `"small" | "medium" | "large"`\ **Default:** `"small"` The size of the button. #### `button-style` [Section titled “button-style”](#button-style) **Type:** `"ghost" | "outline" | "purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"purple"` The style of the button. When using `ghost`, the button itself is invisible and only the content of the button will be shown. In JavaScript, set this property using the `buttonStyle` property to avoid conflict with the native `style` property. #### `button-border-radius` [Section titled “button-border-radius”](#button-border-radius) **Type:** `"normal" | "rounded"`\ **Default:** `"normal"` **Added in:** `astro@4.8.0` The border radius of the button. When using `rounded`, the button will have rounded corners and uniform padding on all sides. In JavaScript, set this property using the `buttonBorderRadius` property. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-badge` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-badge”](#astro-dev-toolbar-badge) Shows a badge. The slot of the component will be used as the content of the badge. ```html <astro-dev-toolbar-badge>My badge</astro-dev-toolbar-badge> ``` #### `size` [Section titled “size”](#size-1) **Type:** `"small" | "large"`\ **Default:** `"small"` The size of the badge. #### `badge-style` [Section titled “badge-style”](#badge-style) **Type:** `"purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"purple"` The style (color) of the badge. In JavaScript, set this property using the `badgeStyle` property to avoid conflict with the native `style` property. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-card` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-card”](#astro-dev-toolbar-card) Shows a card. Specify an optional `link` attribute to make the card act like an `<a>` element. When making a card using JavaScript, a `clickAction` property can be specified to make the card act like a `<button>` element. The slot of the component will be used as the content of the card. ```html <astro-dev-toolbar-card icon="astro:logo" link="https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/new/choose">Report an issue</astro-dev-toolbar-card> ``` #### `card-style` [Section titled “card-style”](#card-style) **Type:** `"purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"purple"` The style of the card. The color is only applied to the border of the card on hover. In JavaScript, set this property using the `cardStyle`. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-toggle` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-toggle”](#astro-dev-toolbar-toggle) Shows a toggle element, acting as a checkbox. This element internally is a simple wrapper around a native `<input type="checkbox">` element. The checkbox element can be accessed using the `input` property. ```ts const toggle = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-toggle'); toggle.input.addEventListener('change', (evt) => { console.log(`The toggle is now ${evt.currentTarget.checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}!`); }); ``` #### `toggle-style` [Section titled “toggle-style”](#toggle-style) **Type:** `"purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"gray"` The style of the toggle. In JavaScript, set this property using the `toggleStyle` property. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-radio-checkbox` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-radio-checkbox”](#astro-dev-toolbar-radio-checkbox) **Added in:** `astro@4.8.0` Shows a radio checkbox. Similar to the `astro-dev-toolbar-toggle` component, this element is a simple wrapper around a native `<input type="radio">` element. The radio element can be accessed using the `input` property. ```ts const radio = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-radio-checkbox'); radio.input.addEventListener('change', (evt) => { console.log(`The radio is now ${evt.currentTarget.checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}!`); }); ``` #### `radio-style` [Section titled “radio-style”](#radio-style) **Type:** `"purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"purple"` The style of the radio. In JavaScript, set this property using the `radioStyle` property. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-highlight` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-highlight”](#astro-dev-toolbar-highlight) Can be used to highlight an element on the page. In most cases, you’ll want to position and resize this element using the `top`, `left`, `width` and `height` CSS properties to match the element you want to highlight. ```html <!-- Highlight the entire page --> <astro-dev-toolbar-highlight style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></astro-dev-toolbar-highlight> ``` ```ts const elementToHighlight = document.querySelector('h1'); const rect = elementToHighlight.getBoundingClientRect(); const highlight = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-highlight'); highlight.style.top = `${Math.max(rect.top + window.scrollY - 10, 0)}px`; highlight.style.left = `${Math.max(rect.left + window.scrollX - 10, 0)}px`; highlight.style.width = `${rect.width + 15}px`; highlight.style.height = `${rect.height + 15}px`; highlight.icon = 'astro:logo'; ``` #### `highlight-style` [Section titled “highlight-style”](#highlight-style) **Type:** `"purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"purple"` The style of the highlight. #### `icon` [Section titled “icon”](#icon-1) An [icon](#icons) to show in the top right corner of the highlight. ### `astro-dev-toolbar-tooltip` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-tooltip”](#astro-dev-toolbar-tooltip) Shows a tooltip with different sections. This component is set to `display: none;` by default and can be made visible using a `data-show="true"` attribute. Sections are defined using the `sections` property. This property is an array of objects with the following shape: ```ts { title?: string; // Title of the section inlineTitle?: string; // Title of the section, shown inline next to the title icon?: Icon; // Icon of the section content?: string; // Content of the section clickAction?: () => void | Promise<void>; // Action to perform when clicking on the section clickDescription?: string; // Description of the action to perform when clicking on the section } ``` ```ts const tooltip = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-tooltip'); tooltip.sections = [{ title: 'My section', icon: 'astro:logo', content: 'My content', clickAction: () => { console.log('Clicked!') }, clickDescription: 'Click me!' }] ``` This component is often combined with the `astro-dev-toolbar-highlight` component to show a tooltip when hovering a highlighted element: ```ts const highlight = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-highlight'); // Position the highlight... const tooltip = document.createElement('astro-dev-toolbar-tooltip'); // Add sections to the tooltip... highlight.addEventListener('mouseover', () => { tooltip.dataset.show = 'true'; }); highlight.addEventListener('mouseout', () => { tooltip.dataset.show = 'false'; }); ``` ### `astro-dev-toolbar-icon` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-icon”](#astro-dev-toolbar-icon) Shows an icon. An icon from [the icon list](#icons) can be specified using the `icon` attribute, or the SVG markup of an icon can be passed as a slot. ```html <astro-dev-toolbar-icon icon="astro:logo" /> ``` ```html <astro-dev-toolbar-icon> <svg>...</svg> </astro-dev-toolbar-icon> ``` ### `astro-dev-toolbar-select` [Section titled “astro-dev-toolbar-select”](#astro-dev-toolbar-select) **Added in:** `astro@4.6.0` Shows a select element. Similar to the `astro-dev-toolbar-toggle` component, this element is a simple wrapper around a native `<select>` element. Use the `element` property to have access to the select element. ```ts const mySelect = document.createElement("astro-dev-toolbar-select"); const options = [ { label: "First option", value: "first" }, { label: "Second option", value: "second", isDefault: true }, ]; const myOptions = options.map((option) => { const optionEl = document.createElement("option"); optionEl.textContent = option.label; optionEl.setAttribute("value", option.value); optionEl.selected = option.isDefault || false; return optionEl; }); mySelect.selectStyle = "green"; mySelect.append(...myOptions); mySelect.element.addEventListener("change", (evt) => { if (evt.currentTarget instanceof HTMLSelectElement) { console.log(`The select value is now ${evt.currentTarget.value}!`); } }); ``` #### `select-style` [Section titled “select-style”](#select-style) **Type:** `"purple" | "gray" | "red" | "green" | "yellow" | "blue"`\ **Default:** `"gray"` The style of the select. In JavaScript, set this property using the `selectStyle` property. #### Icons [Section titled “Icons”](#icons) Currently, the following icons are available and can be used in any component that accepts an icon: * `astro:logo` * `warning` * `arrow-down` * `bug` * `check-circle` * `gear` * `lightbulb` * `file-search` * `star` * `checkmark` * `dots-three` * `copy` * `compress` * `grid` * `puzzle` * `approveUser` * `checkCircle` * `resizeImage` * `searchFile` * `image` * `robot` * `sitemap` * `gauge` * `person-arms-spread` * `arrow-left` * `houston-detective` All of the above icons have `fill="currentColor"` set by default and will inherit their color from the parent element.

# Template directives reference

**Template directives** are a special kind of HTML attribute available inside of any Astro component template (`.astro` files), and some can also be used in `.mdx` files. Template directives are used to control an element or component’s behavior in some way. A template directive could enable some compiler feature that makes your life easier (like using `class:list` instead of `class`). Or, a directive could tell the Astro compiler to do something special with that component (like hydrating with `client:load`). This page describes all of the template directives available to you in Astro, and how they work. ## Rules [Section titled “Rules”](#rules) For a template directive to be valid, it must: * Include a colon `:` in its name, using the form `X:Y` (ex: `client:load`). * Be visible to the compiler (ex: `<X {...attr}>` would not work if `attr` contained a directive). Some template directives, but not all, can take a custom value: * `<X client:load />` (takes no value) * `<X class:list={['some-css-class']} />` (takes an array) A template directive is never included directly in the final HTML output of a component. ## Common Directives [Section titled “Common Directives”](#common-directives) ### `class:list` [Section titled “class:list”](#classlist) `class:list={...}` takes an array of class values and converts them into a class string. This is powered by @lukeed’s popular [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) helper library. `class:list` takes an array of several different possible value kinds: * `string`: Added to the element `class` * `Object`: All truthy keys are added to the element `class` * `Array`: flattened * `false`, `null`, or `undefined`: skipped ```astro <!-- This --> <span class:list={[ 'hello goodbye', { world: true }, [ 'friend' ] ]} /> <!-- Becomes --> <span class="hello goodbye world friend"></span> ``` ### `set:html` [Section titled “set:html”](#sethtml) `set:html={string}` injects an HTML string into an element, similar to setting `el.innerHTML`. **The value is not automatically escaped by Astro!** Be sure that you trust the value, or that you have escaped it manually before passing it to the template. Forgetting to do this will open you up to [Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) ```astro --- const rawHTMLString = "Hello <strong>World</strong>" --- <h1>{rawHTMLString}</h1> <!-- Output: <h1>Hello &lt;strong&gt;World&lt;/strong&gt;</h1> --> <h1 set:html={rawHTMLString} /> <!-- Output: <h1>Hello <strong>World</strong></h1> --> ``` You can also use `set:html` on a `<Fragment>` to avoid adding an unnecessary wrapper element. This can be especially useful when fetching HTML from a CMS. ```astro --- const cmsContent = await fetchHTMLFromMyCMS(); --- <Fragment set:html={cmsContent}> ``` `set:html={Promise<string>}` injects an HTML string into an element that is wrapped in a Promise. This can be used to inject HTML stored externally, such as in a database. ```astro --- import api from '../db/api.js'; --- <article set:html={api.getArticle(Astro.props.id)}></article> ``` `set:html={Promise<Response>}` injects a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) into an element. This is most helpful when using `fetch()`. For example, fetching old posts from a previous static-site generator. ```astro <article set:html={fetch('http://example/old-posts/making-soup.html')}></article> ``` `set:html` can be used on any tag and does not have to include HTML. For example, use with [`JSON.stringify()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) on a `<script>` tag to add a [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) schema to your page. ```astro <script type="application/ld+json" set:html={JSON.stringify({ "@context": "https://schema.org/", "@type": "Person", name: "Houston", hasOccupation: { "@type": "Occupation", name: "Astronaut" } })}/> ``` ### `set:text` [Section titled “set:text”](#settext) `set:text={string}` injects a text string into an element, similar to setting `el.innerText`. Unlike `set:html`, the `string` value that is passed is automatically escaped by Astro. This is equivalent to just passing a variable into a template expression directly (ex: `<div>{someText}</div>`) and therefore this directive is not commonly used. ## Client Directives [Section titled “Client Directives”](#client-directives) These directives control how [UI Framework components](/en/guides/framework-components/) are hydrated on the page. By default, a UI Framework component is not hydrated in the client. If no `client:*` directive is provided, its HTML is rendered onto the page without JavaScript. A client directive can only be used on a UI framework component that is directly imported into a `.astro` component. Hydration directives are not supported when using [dynamic tags](/en/reference/astro-syntax/#dynamic-tags) and [custom components passed via the `components` prop](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#passing-components-to-mdx-content). ### `client:load` [Section titled “client:load”](#clientload) * **Priority:** High * **Useful for:** Immediately-visible UI elements that need to be interactive as soon as possible. Load and hydrate the component JavaScript immediately on page load. ```astro <BuyButton client:load /> ``` ### `client:idle` [Section titled “client:idle”](#clientidle) * **Priority:** Medium * **Useful for:** Lower-priority UI elements that don’t need to be immediately interactive. Load and hydrate the component JavaScript once the page is done with its initial load and the `requestIdleCallback` event has fired. If you are in a browser that doesn’t support [`requestIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback), then the document [`load`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event) event is used. ```astro <ShowHideButton client:idle /> ``` #### `timeout` [Section titled “timeout”](#timeout) **Added in:** `astro@4.15.0` The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, before hydrating the component, even if the page is not yet done with its initial load. This allows you to pass a value for [the `timeout` option from the `requestIdleCallback()` specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/requestidlecallback/#the-requestidlecallback-method). This means you can delay hydration for lower-priority UI elements with more control to ensure your element is interactive within a specified time frame. ```astro <ShowHideButton client:idle={{timeout: 500}} /> ``` ### `client:visible` [Section titled “client:visible”](#clientvisible) * **Priority:** Low * **Useful for:** Low-priority UI elements that are either far down the page (“below the fold”) or so resource-intensive to load that you would prefer not to load them at all if the user never saw the element. Load and hydrate the component JavaScript once the component has entered the user’s viewport. This uses an `IntersectionObserver` internally to keep track of visibility. ```astro <HeavyImageCarousel client:visible /> ``` #### `client:visible={{rootMargin}}` [Section titled “client:visible={{rootMargin}}”](#clientvisiblerootmargin) **Added in:** `astro@4.1.0` Optionally, a value for `rootMargin` can be passed to the underlying `IntersectionObserver`. When `rootMargin` is specified, the component JavaScript will hydrate when a specified margin (in pixels) around the component enters the viewport, rather than the component itself. ```astro <HeavyImageCarousel client:visible={{rootMargin: "200px"}} /> ``` Specifying a `rootMargin` value can reduce layout shifts (CLS), allow more time for a component to hydrate on slower internet connections, and make components interactive sooner, enhancing the stability and responsiveness of the page. ### `client:media` [Section titled “client:media”](#clientmedia) * **Priority:** Low * **Useful for:** Sidebar toggles, or other elements that might only be visible on certain screen sizes. `client:media={string}` loads and hydrates the component JavaScript once a certain CSS media query is met. ```astro <SidebarToggle client:media="(max-width: 50em)" /> ``` ### `client:only` [Section titled “client:only”](#clientonly) `client:only={string}` **skips** HTML server rendering, and renders only on the client. It acts similarly to `client:load` in that it loads, renders, and hydrates the component immediately on page load. **You must pass the component’s correct framework as a value!** Because Astro doesn’t run the component during your build / on the server, Astro doesn’t know what framework your component uses unless you tell it explicitly. ```astro <SomeReactComponent client:only="react" /> <SomePreactComponent client:only="preact" /> <SomeSvelteComponent client:only="svelte" /> <SomeVueComponent client:only="vue" /> <SomeSolidComponent client:only="solid-js" /> ``` #### Display loading content [Section titled “Display loading content”](#display-loading-content) For components that render only on the client, it is also possible to display fallback content while they are loading. Use `slot="fallback"` on any child element to create content that will be displayed only until your client component is available: ```astro <ClientComponent client:only="vue"> <div slot="fallback">Loading</div> </ClientComponent> ``` ### Custom Client Directives [Section titled “Custom Client Directives”](#custom-client-directives) Since Astro 2.6.0, integrations can also add custom `client:*` directives to change how and when components should be hydrated. Visit the [`addClientDirective` API](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#addclientdirective-option) page to learn more about creating a custom client directive. ## Server Directives [Section titled “Server Directives”](#server-directives) These directives control how server island components are rendered. ### `server:defer` [Section titled “server:defer”](#serverdefer) The `server:defer` directive transforms the component into a server island, causing it to be rendered on demand, outside the scope of the rest of the page rendering. See more about using [server island components](/en/guides/server-islands/). ```astro <Avatar server:defer /> ``` ## Script & Style Directives [Section titled “Script & Style Directives”](#script--style-directives) These directives can only be used on HTML `<script>` and `<style>` tags, to control how your client-side JavaScript and CSS are handled on the page. ### `is:global` [Section titled “is:global”](#isglobal) By default, Astro automatically scopes `<style>` CSS rules to the component. You can opt-out of this behavior with the `is:global` directive. `is:global` makes the contents of a `<style>` tag apply globally on the page when the component is included. This disables Astro’s CSS scoping system. This is equivalent to wrapping all of the selectors within a `<style>` tag with `:global()`. You can combine `<style>` and `<style is:global>` together in the same component, to create some global style rules while still scoping most of your component CSS. See the [Styling & CSS](/en/guides/styling/#global-styles) page for more details about how global styles work. ```astro <style is:global> body a { color: red; } </style> ``` ### `is:inline` [Section titled “is:inline”](#isinline) By default, Astro will process, optimize, and bundle any `<script>` and `<style>` tags that it sees on the page. You can opt-out of this behavior with the `is:inline` directive. `is:inline` tells Astro to leave the `<script>` or `<style>` tag as-is in the final output HTML. The contents will not be processed, optimized, or bundled. This limits some Astro features, like importing an npm package or using a compile-to-CSS language like Sass. The `is:inline` directive means that `<style>` and `<script>` tags: * Will not be bundled into an external file. This means that [attributes like `defer`](https://javascript.info/script-async-defer) which control the loading of an external file will have no effect. * Will not be deduplicated—the element will appear as many times as it is rendered. * Will not have its `import`/`@import`/`url()` references resolved relative to the `.astro` file. * Will be rendered in the final output HTML exactly where it is authored. * Styles will be global and not scoped to the component. Caution The `is:inline` directive is implied whenever any attribute other than `src` is used on a `<script>` or `<style>` tag. The one exception is using the [`define:vars` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars) on the `<style>` tag, which does not automatically imply `is:inline`. ```astro <style is:inline> /* inline: relative & npm package imports are not supported. */ @import '/assets/some-public-styles.css'; span { color: green; } </style> <script is:inline> /* inline: relative & npm package imports are not supported. */ console.log('I am inlined right here in the final output HTML.'); </script> ``` See how [client-side scripts](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) work in Astro components. ### `define:vars` [Section titled “define:vars”](#definevars) `define:vars={...}` can pass server-side variables from your component frontmatter into the client `<script>` or `<style>` tags. Any JSON-serializable frontmatter variable is supported, including `props` passed to your component through `Astro.props`. Values are serialized with [`JSON.stringify()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). ```astro --- const foregroundColor = "rgb(221 243 228)"; const backgroundColor = "rgb(24 121 78)"; const message = "Astro is awesome!"; --- <style define:vars={{ textColor: foregroundColor, backgroundColor }}> h1 { background-color: var(--backgroundColor); color: var(--textColor); } </style> <script define:vars={{ message }}> alert(message); </script> ``` Caution Using `define:vars` on a `<script>` tag implies the [`is:inline` directive](#isinline), which means your scripts won’t be bundled and will be inlined directly into the HTML. This is because when Astro bundles a script, it includes and runs the script once even if you include the component containing the script multiple times on one page. `define:vars` requires a script to rerun with each set of values, so Astro creates an inline script instead. For scripts, try [passing variables to scripts manually](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#pass-frontmatter-variables-to-scripts) instead. ## Advanced Directives [Section titled “Advanced Directives”](#advanced-directives) ### `is:raw` [Section titled “is:raw”](#israw) `is:raw` instructs the Astro compiler to treat any children of that element as text. This means that all special Astro templating syntax will be ignored inside of this component. For example, if you had a custom Katex component that converted some text to HTML, you could have users do this: ```astro --- import Katex from '../components/Katex.astro'; --- <Katex is:raw>Some conflicting {syntax} here</Katex> ```

Received `SRC` (type: `TYPEOF_OPTIONS`).\ > \ > Full serialized options received: `FULL_OPTIONS`. ## What went wrong? [Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong) An image’s `src` property is not valid. The Image component requires the `src` attribute to be either an image that has been ESM imported or a string.

# Expected image options.

> **ExpectedImageOptions**: Expected getImage() parameter to be an object. Received `OPTIONS`. ## What went wrong? [Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong) `getImage()`’s first parameter should be an object with the different properties to apply to your image. ```ts import { getImage } from "astro:assets"; import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; const optimizedImage = await getImage({src: myImage, width: 300, height: 300}); ``` In most cases, this error happens because parameters were passed directly instead of inside an object. **See Also:** * [Images](/en/guides/images/)

# Expected image options, not an ESM-imported image.

> **ExpectedNotESMImage**: An ESM-imported image cannot be passed directly to `getImage()`. Instead, pass an object with the image in the `src` property. ## What went wrong?

# Could not import file.

> **FailedToLoadModuleSSR**: Could not import `IMPORT_NAME`. ## What went wrong? [Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong) Astro could not import the requested file. Oftentimes, this is caused by the import path being wrong (either because the file does not exist, or there is a typo in the path) This message can also appear when a type is imported without specifying that it is a [type import](/en/guides/typescript/#type-imports). **See Also:** * [Type Imports](/en/guides/typescript/#type-imports)

# Glob patterns are not supported in the file loader

> **FileGlobNotSupported**: Glob patterns are not supported in the `file` loader. Use the `glob` loader instead. ## What went wrong?

# Configuring experimental flags

Experimental features are available only after enabling a flag in the Astro configuration file. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { // enable experimental flags // to try out new features }, }); ``` Astro offers experimental flags to give users early access to new features for testing and feedback. These flags allow you to participate in feature development by reporting issues and sharing your opinions. These features are not guaranteed to be stable and may include breaking changes even in small `patch` releases while the feature is actively developed. We recommend [updating Astro](/en/upgrade-astro/#upgrade-to-the-latest-version) frequently, and keeping up with release notes in the [Astro changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) which will inform you of any changes needed to your project code. The experimental feature documentation will always be updated for the current released version only.

# Experimental Chrome DevTools workspace

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.13.0` Enables experimental [Chrome DevTools workspace integration](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces) for the Astro dev server. This feature allows you to edit files directly in Chrome DevTools and have those changes reflected in your local file system via a connected workspace folder. This is useful for applying edits such as adjusting CSS values without leaving your browser tab. With this feature enabled, running `astro dev` will automatically configure a Chrome DevTools workspace for your project. Your project will then appear as an available [workspace source that you can connect](#connecting-your-project). Then, changes that you make in the “Sources” panel are automatically saved to your project source code. To enable this feature, add the experimental flag `chromeDevtoolsWorkspace` to your Astro config: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ + experimental: { + chromeDevtoolsWorkspace: true, + }, }); ``` ## Connecting your project [Section titled “Connecting your project”](#connecting-your-project) Astro will create the necessary configuration file to support Chrome DevTools workspaces. However, your project must also be [connected as a source](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces#manual-connection) to enable file saving. 1. [Start the Astro dev server](/en/develop-and-build/#start-the-astro-dev-server) with the appropriate CLI command for your package manager. 2. Navigate to your site preview (e.g. `http://localhost:4321/`) in Chrome and open DevTools. 3. Under the **Sources** > **Workspaces** tab, you will find your Astro project folder. Click **Connect** to add your directory as a workspace. See the [Chrome DevTools workspace documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces#connect) for more information.

# Experimental client prerendering

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@4.2.0` Enables pre-rendering your prefetched pages on the client in supported browsers. This feature uses the experimental [Speculation Rules Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) and enhances the default `prefetch` behavior globally to prerender links on the client. You may wish to review the [possible risks when prerendering on the client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API#unsafe_prefetching) before enabling this feature. Enable client side prerendering in your `astro.config.mjs` along with any desired `prefetch` configuration options: astro.config.mjs ```js { prefetch: { prefetchAll: true, defaultStrategy: 'viewport', }, experimental: { clientPrerender: true, }, } ``` Continue to use the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute on any `<a />` link on your site to opt in to prefetching. Instead of appending a `<link>` tag to the head of the document or fetching the page with JavaScript, a `<script>` tag will be appended with the corresponding speculation rules. Client side prerendering requires browser support. If the Speculation Rules API is not supported, `prefetch` will fallback to the supported strategy. See the [Prefetch Guide](/en/guides/prefetch/) for more `prefetch` options and usage.

# Experimental Intellisense for content collections

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@4.14.0` Enables Intellisense features (e.g. code completion, quick hints) for your content collection entries in compatible editors. When enabled, this feature will generate and add JSON schemas to the `.astro` directory in your project. These files can be used by the Astro language server to provide Intellisense inside content files (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.mdoc`). ```js { experimental: { contentIntellisense: true, }, } ``` To use this feature with the Astro VS Code extension, you must also enable the `astro.content-intellisense` option in your VS Code settings. For editors using the Astro language server directly, pass the `contentIntellisense: true` initialization parameter to enable this feature.

# Experimental Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Type:** `boolean | object`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Enables support for [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) to help minimize certain types of security threats by controlling which resources a document is allowed to load. This provides additional protection against [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks. Enabling this feature adds additional security to **Astro’s handling of processed and bundled scripts and styles** by default, and allows you to further configure these, and additional, content types. This experimental CSP feature has some limitations. Inline scripts are not supported out of the box, but you can [provide your own hashes](#hashes) for external and inline scripts. [Astro’s view transitions](/en/guides/view-transitions/) using the `<ClientRouter />` are not supported, but you can [consider migrating to the browser native View Transition API](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/astro-view-transitions/) instead if you are not using Astro’s enhancements to the native View Transitions and Navigation APIs. To enable this feature, add the experimental flag in your Astro config: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ + experimental: { + csp: true + } }); ``` When enabled, Astro will add a `<meta>` element inside the `<head>` element of each page. This element will have the `http-equiv="content-security-policy"` attribute, and the `content` attribute will provide values for the `script-src` and `style-src` [directives](#directives) based on the script and styles used in the page. ```html <head> <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; " > </head> ``` ## Configuration [Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration) You can further customize the `<meta>` element by enabling this feature with a configuration object that includes additional options. ### `algorithm` [Section titled “algorithm”](#algorithm) **Type:** `'SHA-256' | 'SHA-512' | 'SHA-384'`\ **Default:** `'SHA-256'` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` The [hash function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hash_function) to use when generating the hashes of the styles and scripts emitted by Astro. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { algorithm: 'SHA-512' } } }); ``` ### `directives` [Section titled “directives”](#directives) **Type:** `CspDirective[]`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` A list of [CSP directives](https://content-security-policy.com/#directive) that defines valid sources for specific content types. While Astro needs to control the `script-src` and `style-src` directives, it is possible to control other CSP directives using the `csp.directives` field. These directives are added to all pages. It accepts a list of type-safe directives: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { directives: [ "default-src 'self'", "img-src 'self' https://images.cdn.example.com" ] } } }); ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element will add your directives into the `content` value alongside Astro’s default directives: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' 'https://images.cdn.example.com'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; " > ``` ### `styleDirective` and `scriptDirective` [Section titled “styleDirective and scriptDirective”](#styledirective-and-scriptdirective) **Type:** `object`\ **Default:** `{}` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Configuration objects that allow you to override the default sources for the `style-src` and `script-src` directives with the [`resources`](#resources) property, or to provide additional [hashes](#hashes) to be rendered. These properties are added to all pages and **completely override Astro’s default resources**, not add to them. Therefore, you must explicitly specify any default values that you want to be included. #### `resources` [Section titled “resources”](#resources) **Type:** `string[]`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` A list of valid sources for the `script-src` and `style-src` directives, including [values for subclasses](#adding-values-for-subclasses). The `script-src` and `style-src` directives are handled by Astro by default, and use the `'self'` resource. This means that scripts and styles can only be downloaded by the current host (usually the current website). To override the default source, you can provide a list of resources instead. This will not include `'self'` by default, and must be included in this list if you wish to keep it. These resources are added to all pages. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { styleDirective: { resources: [ "'self'", "https://styles.cdn.example.com" ] }, scriptDirective: { resources: [ "https://cdn.example.com" ] } } } }); ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element will instead apply your sources to the `style-src` and `script-src` directives: ```html <head> <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src https://cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash'; style-src 'self' https://styles.cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash'; " > </head> ``` ##### Adding values for subclasses [Section titled “Adding values for subclasses”](#adding-values-for-subclasses) You can also use this field to add valid values that belong to [`script-src-attr`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src-attr), [`script-src-elem`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src-elem), [`style-src-attr`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src-attr) and [`style-src-elem`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src-elem), such as `unsafe-hashes` and `unsafe-inline`. For example, if you have an external library that adds scripts or inline styles to some HTML elements of the page, you can add `unsafe-inline` to tell the browser that they are safe to render. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { styleDirective: { resources: [ "'unsafe-inline'" ] }, scriptDirective: { resources: [ "'unsafe-inline'" ] } } } }); ``` After the build, `style-src` and `script-src` directives will contain the `'unsafe-line'` resource: ```html <head> <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src 'unsafe-line'; style-src 'unsafe-line'; " > </head> ``` ##### Multiple resources [Section titled “Multiple resources”](#multiple-resources) When resources are inserted multiple times or from multiple sources (e.g. defined in your `csp` config and added using [the CSP runtime API](#runtime-apis)), Astro will remove any duplicates, and merge the new ones. In the following example, the directives `img-src https://global.cdn.example.org` and `default-src https://global.cdn.example.org` are set in `csp` configuration and will be applied to all pages. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { directives: [ "img-src https://global.cdn.example.org", "default-src https://global.cdn.example.org" ] } } }) ``` Additionally, on an individual page, the resources `img-src https://vendor.cdn.example.org/` and `default-src https://global.cdn.example.org/ https://vendor.cdn.example.org/` are added using the [Astro.csp.insertDirective](#cspinsertdirective). src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- Astro.csp.insertDirective("img-src https://vendor.cdn.example.org") Astro.csp.insertDirective("default-src https://global.cdn.example.org https://vendor.cdn.example.org") --- ``` During the build, the resources of the directives `img-src` and `default-src` for the `index.html` page are merged and deduplicated to create the appropriate headers. ```html <head> <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" img-src https://global.cdn.example.org https://vendor.cdn.example.org; default-src https://global.cdn.example.org https://vendor.cdn.example.org; " > </head> ``` #### `hashes` [Section titled “hashes”](#hashes) **Type:** `CspHash[]`\ **Default:** `[]` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` A list of additional hashes to be rendered. If you have external scripts or styles that aren’t generated by Astro, or inline scripts, this configuration option allows you to provide additional hashes to be rendered. You must provide hashes that start with `sha384-`, `sha512-` or `sha256-`. Other values will cause a validation error. These hashes are added to all pages. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { styleDirective: { hashes: [ "sha384-styleHash", "sha512-styleHash", "sha256-styleHash" ] }, scriptDirective: { hashes: [ "sha384-scriptHash", "sha512-scriptHash", "sha256-scriptHash" ] } } } }); ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element will include your additional hashes in the `script-src` and `style-src` directives: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src 'self' 'sha384-scriptHash' 'sha512-scriptHash' 'sha256-scriptHash' 'sha256-generatedByAstro'; style-src 'self' 'sha384-styleHash' 'sha512-styleHash' 'sha256-styleHash' 'sha256-generatedByAstro'; " > ``` #### `strictDynamic` [Section titled “strictDynamic”](#strictdynamic) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Enables [the `strict-dynamic` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#the_strict-dynamic_keyword) to support the dynamic injection of scripts. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { csp: { scriptDirective: { strictDynamic: true } } } }); ``` ## Runtime APIs [Section titled “Runtime APIs”](#runtime-apis) You can customize the `<meta>` element per page via runtime APIs available from the `Astro` global inside `.astro` components, or the `APIContext` type in endpoints and middleware. ### `csp.insertDirective` [Section titled “csp.insertDirective”](#cspinsertdirective) **Type:** `(directive: CspDirective) => void` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Adds a single directive to the current page. You can call this method multiple times to add additional directives. ```astro --- Astro.csp.insertDirective("default-src 'self'"); Astro.csp.insertDirective("img-src 'self' https://images.cdn.example.com"); --- ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will incorporate your additional directives alongside the existing `script-src` and `style-src` directives: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://images.cdn.example.com; script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; " > ``` ### `csp.insertStyleResource` [Section titled “csp.insertStyleResource”](#cspinsertstyleresource) **Type:** `(resource: string) => void` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Inserts a new resource to be used for the `style-src` directive. ```astro --- Astro.csp.insertStyleResource("https://styles.cdn.example.com"); --- ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will add your source to the default `style-src` directive: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; style-src https://styles.cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash'; " > ``` ### `csp.insertStyleHash` [Section titled “csp.insertStyleHash”](#cspinsertstylehash) **Type:** `(hash: CspHash) => void` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Adds a new hash to the `style-src` directive. ```astro --- Astro.csp.insertStyleHash("sha512-styleHash"); --- ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will add your hash to the default `style-src` directive: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash' 'sha512-styleHash'; " > ``` ### `csp.insertScriptResource` [Section titled “csp.insertScriptResource”](#cspinsertscriptresource) **Type:** `(resource: string) => void` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Inserts a new valid source to be used for the `script-src` directive. ```astro --- Astro.csp.insertScriptResource("https://scripts.cdn.example.com"); --- ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will add your source to the default `script-src` directive: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src https://scripts.cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash'; style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; " > ``` ### `csp.insertScriptHash` [Section titled “csp.insertScriptHash”](#cspinsertscripthash) **Type:** `(hash: CspHash) => void` **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0` Adds a new hash to the `script-src` directive. ```astro --- Astro.csp.insertScriptHash("sha512-scriptHash"); --- ``` After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will add your hash to the default `script-src` directive: ```html <meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content=" script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash' 'sha512-styleHash'; style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash'; " > ```

# Experimental prerender conflict error

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.14.0` Turns prerender conflict warnings into errors during the build process. Astro currently warns you during the build about any conflicts between multiple dynamic routes that can result in the same output path. For example `/blog/[slug]` and `/blog/[...all]` both could try to prerender the `/blog/post-1` path. In such cases, Astro renders only the [highest priority route](/en/guides/routing/#route-priority-order) for the conflicting path. This allows your site to build successfully, although you may discover that some pages are rendered by unexpected routes. With this experimental flag set, the build will instead fail immediately with an error. This will require you to resolve any routing conflicts immediately, and will ensure that Astro is building your routes as you intend. To enable this behavior, add the `experimental.failOnPrerenderConflict` feature flag to your Astro config: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from "astro/config" defineConfig({ + experimental: { + failOnPrerenderConflict: true, + }, }); ``` ## Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) After enabling this flag, you may encounter errors about conflicting prerendered routes when you attempt to build your project. If this happens, you will need to update one or more of your [dynamic routes](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) to avoid ambiguous routing.

# Experimental fonts API

**Type:** `FontFamily[]` **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` This experimental feature allows you to use fonts from your filesystem and various font providers (eg. Google, Fontsource, Bunny) through a unified, fully customizable, and type-safe API. Web fonts can impact page performance at both load time and rendering time. This API helps you keep your site performant with automatic [web font optimizations](https://web.dev/learn/performance/optimize-web-fonts) including preload links, optimized fallbacks, and opinionated defaults. [See common usage examples](#usage-examples). The Fonts API focuses on performance and privacy by downloading and caching fonts so they’re served from your site. This can avoid sending user data to third-party sites, and also ensures that a consistent set of fonts is available to all your visitors. To enable this feature, configure an `experimental.fonts` object with at least one font: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { + fonts: [{ + provider: fontProviders.google(), + name: "Roboto", + cssVariable: "--font-roboto" + }] } }); ``` Then, add the `<Font />` component and site-wide styling in your `<head>`: src/components/Head.astro ```diff --- +import { Font } from "astro:assets"; --- +<Font cssVariable="--font-roboto" preload /> <style> +body { +font-family: var(--font-roboto); +} </style> ``` ## Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) 1. `experimental.fonts` accepts an array of font objects. For each font, you must specify a `provider`, the family `name`, and define a `cssVariable` to refer to your font. * [`provider`](#provider): You can choose from the list of [built-in providers](#available-font-providers) or build your own [custom font provider](#build-your-own-font-provider). * [`name`](#name): Choose a font family supported by your provider. * [`cssVariable`](#cssvariable-1): Must be a valid [ident](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ident) in the form of a CSS variable. The following example configures the [“Roboto” family from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto): astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ + experimental: { + fonts: [{ + provider: fontProviders.google(), + name: "Roboto", + cssVariable: "--font-roboto" + }] + } }); ``` More configuration options, such as defining [fallback font families](#fallbacks) and which [`weights`](#weights), [`styles`](#styles), [`subsets`](#subsets) and [`formats`](#formats) to download, are available and some will depend on your chosen provider. See the full [configuration reference](#font-configuration-reference) to learn more. 2. Apply styles using the `<Font />` component. It must be imported and added to your page `<head>`. Providing the font’s [`cssVariable`](#cssvariable) is required, and you can optionally [output preload links](#preload): src/components/Head.astro ```diff --- +import { Font } from "astro:assets"; --- +<Font cssVariable="--font-roboto" preload /> ``` This is commonly done in a component such as `Head.astro` that is used in a common site layout. See the full [`<Font>` component reference](#font--component-reference) for more information. Since the `<Font />` component generates CSS with font declarations, you can reference the font family using the `cssVariable`: * CSS ```diff <style> body { +font-family: var(--font-roboto); } </style> ``` * Tailwind CSS 4.0 src/styles/global.css ```diff @import "tailwindcss"; @theme inline { +--font-sans: var(--font-roboto); } ``` * Tailwind CSS 3.0 tailwind.config.mjs ```diff /** @type {import("tailwindcss").Config} */ export default { content: ["./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}"], theme: { extend: {}, + fontFamily: { + sans: ["var(--font-roboto)"] + } }, plugins: [] }; ``` ## Available font providers [Section titled “Available font providers”](#available-font-providers) Fonts are loaded using a provider, which either downloads font files from a remote service or loads local font files from disk. Astro exports built-in providers for common services. You can also [make a custom Astro font provider](#build-your-own-font-provider). To use a built-in font provider, import `fontProviders` and configure [`provider`](#provider) with the appropriate value for your chosen font provider: astro.config.mjs ```js import { fontProviders } from "astro/config"; ``` * [Adobe](#adobe) * [Bunny](#bunny) * [Fontshare](#fontshare) * [Fontsource](#fontsource) * [Google](#google) * [Google Icons](#google-icons) * [Local](#local) ### Adobe [Section titled “Adobe”](#adobe) Retrieves fonts from [Adobe](https://fonts.adobe.com/): ```js provider: fontProviders.adobe({ id: "your-id" }) ``` Pass the Adobe font provider an ID loaded as an [environment variable in your Astro config file](/en/guides/environment-variables/#in-the-astro-config-file). ### Bunny [Section titled “Bunny”](#bunny) Retrieves fonts from [Bunny](https://fonts.bunny.net/): ```js provider: fontProviders.bunny() ``` ### Fontshare [Section titled “Fontshare”](#fontshare) Retrieves fonts from [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/): ```js provider: fontProviders.fontshare() ``` ### Fontsource [Section titled “Fontsource”](#fontsource) Retrieves fonts from [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/): ```js provider: fontProviders.fontsource() ``` ### Google [Section titled “Google”](#google) Retrieves fonts from [Google](https://fonts.google.com/): ```js provider: fontProviders.google() ``` The provider comes with family specific [options](#options). #### experimental.glyphs [Section titled “experimental.glyphs”](#experimentalglyphs) **Type:** `string[]` Allows specifying a list of glyphs to be included in the font for each font family. This can reduce the size of the font file: ```js { // ... provider: fontProviders.google(), options: { experimental: { glyphs: ["a"] } } } ``` #### experimental.variableAxis [Section titled “experimental.variableAxis”](#experimentalvariableaxis) **Type:** `Partial<Record<VariableAxis, ([string, string] | string)[]>>` Allows setting variable axis configuration: ```js { // ... provider: fontProviders.google(), options: { experimental: { variableAxis: { slnt: [["-15", "0"]], CASL: [["0", "1"]], CRSV: ["1"], MONO: [["0", "1"]], } } } } ``` ### Google Icons [Section titled “Google Icons”](#google-icons) **Added in:** `astro@5.16.9` Retrieves fonts from [Google Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons): ```js provider: fontProviders.googleicons() ``` The provider comes with family specific [options](#options). #### experimental.glyphs [Section titled “experimental.glyphs”](#experimentalglyphs-1) **Type:** `string[]` when resolving the new Material Symbols icons, allows specifying a list of glyphs to be included in the font for each font family. This can reduce the size of the font file: ```js { // ... provider: fontProviders.googleicons(), options: { experimental: { glyphs: ["a"] } } } ``` ### Local [Section titled “Local”](#local) **Added in:** `astro@5.16.13` Retrieves fonts from disk: ```js provider: fontProviders.local() ``` The provider comes with required family specific [options](#options). #### variants [Section titled “variants”](#variants) **Type:** `LocalFontFamily["variants"]` The `options.variants` property is required. Each variant represents a [`@font-face` declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/) and requires a [`src`](#src). Additionally, [some other properties](#other-properties) may be specified within each variant. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: fontProviders.local(), name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom", options: { variants: [ { weight: 400, style: "normal", src: ["./src/assets/fonts/custom-400.woff2"] }, { weight: 700, style: "normal", src: ["./src/assets/fonts/custom-700.woff2"] } // ... ] } }] } }); ``` ##### weight [Section titled “weight”](#weight) **Type:** `number | string`\ **Default:** `undefined` A [font weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight): ```js weight: 200 ``` If the associated font is a [variable font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide), you can specify a range of weights: ```js weight: "100 900" ``` When the value is not set, by default Astro will try to infer the value based on the first [`source`](#src). ##### style [Section titled “style”](#style) **Type:** `"normal" | "italic" | "oblique"`\ **Default:** `undefined` A [font style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style): ```js style: "normal" ``` When the value is not set, by default Astro will try to infer the value based on the first [`source`](#src). ##### src [Section titled “src”](#src) **Type:** `(string | URL | { url: string | URL; tech?: string })[]` Font [sources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src). It can be a path relative to the root, a package import or a URL. URLs are particularly useful if you inject local fonts through an integration: * Relative path ```js src: ["./src/assets/fonts/MyFont.woff2", "./src/assets/fonts/MyFont.woff"] ``` * URL ```js src: [new URL("./custom.ttf", import.meta.url)] ``` * Package import ```js src: ["my-package/SomeFont.ttf"] ``` Caution We recommend not putting your font files in [the `public/` directory](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#publicdir). Since Astro will copy these files into that folder at build time, this will result in duplicated files in your build output. Instead, store them somewhere else in your project, such as in [`src/`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#srcdir). You can also specify a [tech](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src#tech) by providing objects: ```js src: [{ url:"./src/assets/fonts/MyFont.woff2", tech: "color-COLRv1" }] ``` ##### Other properties [Section titled “Other properties”](#other-properties) The following options from font families are also available for local font families within variants: * [display](#display) * [unicodeRange](#unicoderange) * [stretch](#stretch) * [featureSettings](#featuresettings) * [variationSettings](#variationsettings) astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: fontProviders.local(), name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom", options: { variants: [ { weight: 400, style: "normal", src: ["./src/assets/fonts/custom-400.woff2"], display: "block" } ] } }] } }); ``` ## Usage examples [Section titled “Usage examples”](#usage-examples) astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [ { name: "Roboto", cssVariable: "--font-roboto", provider: fontProviders.google(), // Default included: // weights: [400] , // styles: ["normal", "italics"], // subsets: ["latin"], // fallbacks: ["sans-serif"], // formats: ["woff2"], }, { name: "Inter", cssVariable: "--font-inter", provider: fontProviders.fontsource(), // Specify weights that are actually used weights: [400, 500, 600, 700], // Specify styles that are actually used styles: ["normal"], // Download only font files for characters used on the page subsets: ["latin", "cyrillic"], // Download more font formats formats: ["woff2", "woff"], }, { name: "JetBrains Mono", cssVariable: "--font-jetbrains-mono", provider: fontProviders.fontsource(), // Download only font files for characters used on the page subsets: ["latin", "latin-ext"], // Use a fallback font family matching the intended appearance fallbacks: ["monospace"], }, { name: "Poppins", cssVariable: "--font-poppins", provider: fontProviders.local(), options: { // Weight and style are not specified so Astro // will try to infer them for each variant variants: [ { src: [ "./src/assets/fonts/Poppins-regular.woff2", "./src/assets/fonts/Poppins-regular.woff", ] }, { src: [ "./src/assets/fonts/Poppins-bold.woff2", "./src/assets/fonts/Poppins-bold.woff", ] }, ] } } ], } }); ``` ## `<Font />` component reference [Section titled “\<Font /> component reference”](#font--component-reference) This component outputs style tags and can optionally output preload links for a given font family. It must be imported and added to your page `<head>`. This is commonly done in a component such as `Head.astro` that is used in a common site layout for global use but may be added to individual pages as needed. With this component, you have control over which font family is used on which page, and which fonts are preloaded. ### cssVariable [Section titled “cssVariable”](#cssvariable) **Example type:** `"--font-roboto" | "--font-comic-sans" | ...` The [`cssVariable`](#cssvariable-1) registered in your Astro configuration: src/components/Head.astro ```astro --- import { Font } from "astro:assets"; --- <Font cssVariable="--font-roboto" /> ``` ### preload [Section titled “preload”](#preload) **Type:** `boolean | { weight?: string | number; style?: string; subset?: string }[]`\ **Default:** `false` Whether to output [preload links](https://web.dev/learn/performance/optimize-web-fonts#preload) or not: src/components/Head.astro ```astro --- import { Font } from "astro:assets"; --- <Font cssVariable="--font-roboto" preload /> ``` With the `preload` directive, the browser will immediately begin downloading all possible font links during page load. #### Granular preloads [Section titled “Granular preloads”](#granular-preloads) **Added in:** `astro@5.15.0` You may not always want to preload every font link, as this can block loading other important resources or may download fonts that are not needed for the current page. To selectively control which font files are preloaded, you can provide an array of objects describing any combination of font `weight`, `style`, or `subset` to preload. The following example will only preload font files with a `400` weight or a `normal` style in the `latin` subset: src/components/Head.astro ```astro --- import { Font } from "astro:assets"; --- <Font cssVariable="--font-roboto" preload={[ { subset: "latin", style: "normal" }, { weight: "400" }, ]} /> ``` Variable weight font files will be preloaded if any weight within its range is requested. For example, a font file for font weight `100 900` will be included when `400` is specified in a `preload` object. ## Accessing font data programmatically [Section titled “Accessing font data programmatically”](#accessing-font-data-programmatically) The [`fontData`](#fontdata) object allows you to retrieve lower-level font family data programmatically. For example, you can use it in an [API Route](/en/guides/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) to generate OpenGraph images using [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), combined with proper [formats](#formats) configuration: src/pages/og.png.tsx ```tsx import type{ APIRoute } from "astro" import { fontData } from "astro:assets" import satori from "satori" export const GET: APIRoute = (context) => { const data = fontData["--font-roboto"] const svg = await satori( <div style={{ color: "black" }}>hello, world</div>, { width: 600, height: 400, fonts: [ { name: "Roboto", data: await fetch(new URL(data[0].src[0].url, context.url.origin)).then(res => res.arrayBuffer()), weight: 400, style: "normal", }, ], }, ) // ... } ``` ### `fontData` [Section titled “fontData”](#fontdata) **Type:** `Record<CssVariable, Array<FontData>>` **Added in:** `astro@5.16.12` An object where each key is a [`cssVariable`](#cssvariable-1) and the value is an array describing the associated fonts. Each font is an object containing an array of `src` available for that font and the following optional properties: `weight` and `style`. ## Font configuration reference [Section titled “Font configuration reference”](#font-configuration-reference) All properties of your fonts must be configured in the Astro config. Set these to customize the data loaded from your [font provider](#available-font-providers), for example, to only download certain font weights or styles. For more control, more [granular configuration](#granular-font-configuration) is available. Each provider is responsible for handling these options, so availability and support for the following properties may vary. [`provider`](#provider), [`name`](#name), and [`cssVariable`](#cssvariable-1) are required. ### provider [Section titled “provider”](#provider) **Type:** `FontProvider` The source of your font files. You can use a [built-in provider](#available-font-providers) or write your own [custom provider](#build-your-own-font-provider): astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: fontProviders.google(), name: "Roboto", cssVariable: "--font-roboto" }] } }); ``` ### name [Section titled “name”](#name) **Type:** `string` The font family name, as identified by your font provider: ```js name: "Roboto" ``` ### cssVariable [Section titled “cssVariable”](#cssvariable-1) **Type:** `string` A valid [ident](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ident) of your choosing in the form of a CSS variable (i.e. starting with `--`): ```js cssVariable: "--font-roboto" ``` ### fallbacks [Section titled “fallbacks”](#fallbacks) **Type:** `string[]`\ **Default:** `["sans-serif"]` An array of fonts to use when your chosen font is unavailable, or loading. Fallback fonts will be chosen in the order listed. The first available font will be used: ```js fallbacks: ["CustomFont", "serif"] ``` To disable fallback fonts completely, configure an empty array: ```js fallbacks: [] ``` Specify at least a [generic family name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#generic-name) matching the intended appearance of your font. Astro will then attempt to generate [optimized fallbacks](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/font-fallbacks) using font metrics. To disable this optimization, set `optimizedFallbacks` to false. ### optimizedFallbacks [Section titled “optimizedFallbacks”](#optimizedfallbacks) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` Whether or not to enable Astro’s default optimization when generating fallback fonts. You may disable this default optimization to have full control over how [`fallbacks`](#fallbacks) are generated: ```js optimizedFallbacks: false ``` ### weights [Section titled “weights”](#weights) **Type:** `(number | string)[]`\ **Default:** `[400]` An array of [font weights](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight). If no value is specified in your configuration, only weight `400` is included by default to prevent unnecessary downloads. You will need to include this property to access any other font weights: ```js weights: [200, "400", "bold"] ``` If the associated font is a [variable font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide), you can specify a range of weights: ```js weights: ["100 900"] ``` ### styles [Section titled “styles”](#styles) **Type:** `("normal" | "italic" | "oblique")[]`\ **Default:** `["normal", "italic"]` An array of [font styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style): ```js styles: ["normal", "oblique"] ``` ### subsets [Section titled “subsets”](#subsets) **Type:** `string[]`\ **Default:** `["latin"]` Defines a list of [font subsets](https://knaap.dev/posts/font-subsetting/) to preload. ```js subsets: ["latin"] ``` ### formats [Section titled “formats”](#formats) **Type:** `("woff2" | "woff" | "otf" | "ttf" | "eot")[]`\ **Default:** `["woff2"]` **Added in:** `astro@5.16.7` An array of [font formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@font-face/src#font_formats): ```js formats: ["woff2", "woff"] ``` ### options [Section titled “options”](#options) **Type:** `Record<string, any>` **Added in:** `astro@5.16.12` An object to pass provider specific options. It is typed automatically based on the font family [provider](#provider): ```js options: { experimental: { glyphs: ["a"] } } ``` ### display [Section titled “display”](#display) **Type:** `"auto" | "block" | "swap" | "fallback" | "optional"`\ **Default:** `"swap"` Defines [how a font displays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) based on when it is downloaded and ready for use: ```js display: "block" ``` ### unicodeRange [Section titled “unicodeRange”](#unicoderange) **Type:** `string[]`\ **Default:** `undefined` Determines when a font must be downloaded and used based on a specific [range of unicode characters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range). If a character on the page matches the configured range, the browser will download the font and all characters will be available for use on the page. To configure a subset of characters preloaded for a single font, see the [subsets](#subsets) property instead. This can be useful for localization to avoid unnecessary font downloads when a specific part of your website uses a different alphabet and will be displayed with a separate font. For example, a website that offers both English and Japanese versions can prevent the browser from downloading the Japanese font on English versions of the page that do not contain any of the Japanese characters provided in `unicodeRange`. ```js unicodeRange: ["U+26"] ``` ### stretch [Section titled “stretch”](#stretch) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `undefined` A [font stretch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-stretch): ```js stretch: "condensed" ``` ### featureSettings [Section titled “featureSettings”](#featuresettings) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `undefined` Controls the [typographic font features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-feature-settings) (e.g. ligatures, small caps, or swashes): ```js featureSettings: "'smcp' 2" ``` ### variationSettings [Section titled “variationSettings”](#variationsettings) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `undefined` Font [variation settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-variation-settings): ```js variationSettings: "'xhgt' 0.7" ``` ## Granular font configuration [Section titled “Granular font configuration”](#granular-font-configuration) **Added in:** `astro@5.15.6` A font family is defined by a combination of properties such as weights and styles (e.g. `weights: [500, 600]` and `styles: ["normal", "bold"]`), but you may want to download only certain combinations of these. For greater control over which font files are downloaded, you can specify the same font (ie. with the same `cssVariable`, `name`, and `provider` properties) multiple times with different combinations. Astro will merge the results and download only the required files. For example, it is possible to download normal `500` and `600` while downloading only italic `500`: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [ { name: "Roboto", cssVariable: "--roboto", provider: fontProviders.google(), weights: [500, 600], styles: ["normal"] }, { name: "Roboto", cssVariable: "--roboto", provider: fontProviders.google(), weights: [500], styles: ["italic"] } ] } }) ``` ## Build your own font provider [Section titled “Build your own font provider”](#build-your-own-font-provider) If you do not wish to use one of the [built-in providers](#available-font-providers) (e.g. you want to use a [3rd-party unifont provider](#supporting-a-3rd-party-unifont-provider) or [build something for a private registry](#supporting-a-private-registry)), you can build your own. The preferred method for implementing a custom font provider is to export a function that returns [the `FontProvider` object](#the-font-provider-object) and takes the [configuration](#config) as a parameter. ### The font provider object [Section titled “The font provider object”](#the-font-provider-object) The experimental Fonts API allows you to access fonts in a unified way. Each family requires the use of an Astro Font Provider to retrieve font faces. A `FontProvider` is an object containing required [`name`](#name-1) and [`resolveFont()`](#resolvefont) properties. It also has optional [`config`](#config), [`init()`](#init) and [`listFonts()`](#listfonts) properties available. The `FontProvider` type accepts a generic for family [options](#options). #### `name` [Section titled “name”](#name-1) **Type:** `string` A unique name for the provider, used in logs and for identification. #### `resolveFont()` [Section titled “resolveFont()”](#resolvefont) **Type:** `(options: ResolveFontOptions) => Awaitable<{ fonts: FontFaceData[] } | undefined>` Used to retrieve and return font face data based on the given options. #### `config` [Section titled “config”](#config) **Type:** `Record<string, any>`\ **Default:** `undefined` A serializable object, used for identification. #### `init()` [Section titled “init()”](#init) **Type:** `(context: FontProviderInitContext) => Awaitable<void>`\ **Default:** `undefined` Optional callback, used to perform any initialization logic. ##### `context.storage` [Section titled “context.storage”](#contextstorage) **Type:** `Storage` Useful for caching ##### `context.root` [Section titled “context.root”](#contextroot) **Type:** `URL` The project root, useful for resolving local files paths. #### `listFonts()` [Section titled “listFonts()”](#listfonts) **Type:** `() => Awaitable<string[] | undefined>`\ **Default:** `undefined` Optional callback, used to return the list of available font names. ### Supporting a private registry [Section titled “Supporting a private registry”](#supporting-a-private-registry) The following example defines a font provider for a private registry: * Simple font-provider.ts ```ts import type { FontProvider } from "astro"; import { retrieveFonts, type Fonts } from "./utils.js", export function registryFontProvider(): FontProvider { let data: Fonts = {} return { name: "registry", init: async () => { data = await retrieveFonts(token); }, listFonts: () => { return Object.keys(data); }, resolveFont: ({ familyName, ...rest }) => { const fonts = data[familyName]; if (fonts) { return { fonts }; } return undefined; }, }; } ``` * Provider options font-provider.ts ```ts import type { FontProvider } from "astro"; import { retrieveFonts, type Fonts } from "./utils.js", interface Config { token: string; } export function registryFontProvider(config: Config): FontProvider { let data: Fonts = {} return { name: "registry", config, init: async () => { data = await retrieveFonts(token); }, listFonts: () => { return Object.keys(data); }, resolveFont: ({ familyName, ...rest }) => { const fonts = data[familyName]; if (fonts) { return { fonts }; } return undefined; }, }; } ``` * Family options font-provider.ts ```ts import type { FontProvider } from "astro"; import { retrieveFonts, type Fonts } from "./utils.js", interface FamilyOptions { minimal?: boolean; } export function registryFontProvider(): FontProvider<FamilyOptions | undefined> { let data: Fonts = {} return { name: "registry", init: async () => { data = await retrieveFonts(token); }, listFonts: () => { return Object.keys(data); }, // options is typed as FamilyOptions | undefined resolveFont: ({ familyName, options, ...rest }) => { const fonts = data[familyName]; if (fonts) { return { fonts }; } return undefined; }, }; } ``` You can then register this font provider in the Astro config: * Simple astro.config.ts ```ts import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; import { registryFontProvider } from "./font-provider"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: registryFontProvider(), name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom" }] } }); ``` * Provider options astro.config.ts ```ts import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; import { registryFontProvider } from "./font-provider"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: registryFontProvider({ token: "..." }), name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom" }] } }); ``` * Family options astro.config.ts ```ts import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; import { registryFontProvider } from "./font-provider"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: registryFontProvider(), options: { minimal: true }, name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom" }] } }); ``` ### Supporting a 3rd-party unifont provider [Section titled “Supporting a 3rd-party unifont provider”](#supporting-a-3rd-party-unifont-provider) You can define an Astro font provider using a unifont provider under the hood: * Simple font-provider.ts ```ts import type { FontProvider } from "astro"; import type { InitializedProvider } from "unifont"; import { acmeProvider } from "@acme/unifont-provider" export function acmeFontProvider(): FontProvider { const provider = acmeProvider(); let initializedProvider: InitializedProvider | undefined; return { name: provider._name, async init(context) { initializedProvider = await provider(context); }, async resolveFont({ familyName, ...rest }) { return await initializedProvider?.resolveFont(familyName, rest); }, async listFonts() { return await initializedProvider?.listFonts?.(); }, }; } ``` * Provider options font-provider.ts ```ts import type { FontProvider } from "astro"; import type { InitializedProvider } from "unifont"; import { acmeProvider, type AcmeOptions } from "@acme/unifont-provider" export function acmeFontProvider(config?: AcmeOptions): FontProvider { const provider = acmeProvider(config); let initializedProvider: InitializedProvider | undefined; return { name: provider._name, config, async init(context) { initializedProvider = await provider(context); }, async resolveFont({ familyName, ...rest }) { return await initializedProvider?.resolveFont(familyName, rest); }, async listFonts() { return await initializedProvider?.listFonts?.(); }, }; } ``` * Family options font-provider.ts ```ts import type { FontProvider } from "astro"; import type { InitializedProvider } from "unifont"; import { acmeProvider, type AcmeFamilyOptions } from "@acme/unifont-provider" export function acmeFontProvider(): FontProvider<AcmeFamilyOptions | undefined> { const provider = acmeProvider(); let initializedProvider: InitializedProvider<AcmeFamilyOptions> | undefined; return { name: provider._name, async init(context) { initializedProvider = await provider(context); }, async resolveFont({ familyName, ...rest }) { return await initializedProvider?.resolveFont(familyName, rest); }, async listFonts() { return await initializedProvider?.listFonts?.(); }, }; } ``` You can then register this font provider in the Astro config: * Simple astro.config.ts ```ts import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; import { acmeFontProvider } from "./font-provider"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: acmeFontProvider(), name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom" }] } }); ``` * Provider options astro.config.ts ```ts import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; import { acmeFontProvider } from "./font-provider"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: acmeFontProvider({ token: "..." }), name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom" }] } }); ``` * Family options astro.config.ts ```ts import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; import { acmeFontProvider } from "./font-provider"; export default defineConfig({ experimental: { fonts: [{ provider: acmeFontProvider(), options: { minimal: true }, name: "Custom", cssVariable: "--font-custom" }] } }); ``` ## Caching [Section titled “Caching”](#caching) The Fonts API caching implementation was designed to be practical in development and efficient in production. During builds, font files are copied to the `_astro/fonts` output directory, so they can benefit from HTTP caching of static assets (usually a year). To clear the cache in development, remove the `.astro/fonts` directory.

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.5.0` The `experimental.headingIdCompat` flag makes the IDs generated by Astro for Markdown headings compatible with common platforms like GitHub and npm. To enable heading ID compatibility, set the flag to `true` in your Astro configuration: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ + experimental: { + headingIdCompat: true, + } }) ``` ## Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) This experimental flag allows you to retain the trailing hyphens on the end of IDs for Markdown headings ending in special characters, creating IDs compatible with those generated by other common platforms. It requires no specific usage and only affects how Astro generates the `id` for your headings written using Markdown syntax. Astro, like many platforms, uses the popular [`github-slugger`](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger) package to convert the text content of a Markdown heading to a slug to use in IDs. This experimental flag allows you to omit Astro’s additional default processing step that strips a trailing hyphen from the end of IDs for headings ending in special characters. For example, the following Markdown heading: ```md ## `<Picture />` ``` will generate the following HTML in Astro by default: ```html <h2 id="picture"><code>&lt;Picture /&gt;</h2> ``` Using `experimental.headingIdCompat`, the same Markdown will generate the following HTML, which is identical to that of platforms such as GitHub: ```html <h2 id="picture-"><code>&lt;Picture /&gt;</h2> ``` In a future major version, Astro will switch to use the compatible ID style by default, but you can opt in to the future behavior early using the `experimental.headingIdCompat` flag. ## Usage with `rehypeHeadingIds` plugin [Section titled “Usage with rehypeHeadingIds plugin”](#usage-with-rehypeheadingids-plugin) If you are [using the `rehypeHeadingIds` plugin](/en/guides/markdown-content/#heading-ids-and-plugins) directly, opt in to the compatibility mode when passing the plugin in your Astro configuration: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; import { rehypeHeadingIds } from '@astrojs/markdown-remark'; import { otherPluginThatReliesOnHeadingIDs } from 'some/plugin/source'; export default defineConfig({ markdown: { rehypePlugins: [ [rehypeHeadingIds, { headingIdCompat: true }], otherPluginThatReliesOnHeadingIDs, ], }, }); ```

# Experimental live content collections

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` Enables support for live content collections in your project. Live content collections are a new type of [content collection](/en/guides/content-collections/) that fetch their data at runtime rather than build time. This allows you to access frequently updated data from CMSs, APIs, databases, or other sources using a unified API, without needing to rebuild your site when the data changes. ## Basic usage [Section titled “Basic usage”](#basic-usage) To enable the feature, make sure you have an adapter configured for [on-demand rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) and add the `experimental.liveContentCollections` flag to your `astro.config.mjs` file: astro.config.mjs ```js { experimental: { liveContentCollections: true, }, } ``` Then create a new `src/live.config.ts` file (alongside your `src/content.config.ts` if you have one) to define your live collections with a [live loader](#creating-a-live-loader) and optionally a [schema](#using-zod-schemas) using the new `defineLiveCollection()` function from the `astro:content` module. src/live.config.ts ```ts import { defineLiveCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { storeLoader } from '@mystore/astro-loader'; const products = defineLiveCollection({ loader: storeLoader({ apiKey: process.env.STORE_API_KEY, endpoint: 'https://api.mystore.com/v1', }), }); export const collections = { products }; ``` You can then use the dedicated `getLiveCollection()` and `getLiveEntry()` functions to access your live data: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveCollection, getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content'; // Get all products const { entries: allProducts, error } = await getLiveCollection('products'); if (error) { // Handle error appropriately console.error(error.message); } // Get products with a filter (if supported by your loader) const { entries: electronics } = await getLiveCollection('products', { category: 'electronics' }); // Get a single product by ID (string syntax) const { entry: product, error: productError } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.id); if (productError) { return Astro.redirect('/404'); } // Get a single product with a custom query (if supported by your loader) using a filter object const { entry: productBySlug } = await getLiveEntry('products', { slug: Astro.params.slug }); --- ``` ## When to use live content collections [Section titled “When to use live content collections”](#when-to-use-live-content-collections) Live content collections are designed for data that changes frequently and needs to be up-to-date when a page is requested. Consider using them when: * **You need real-time information** (e.g. user-specific data, current stock levels) * **You want to avoid constant rebuilds** for content that changes often * **Your data updates frequently** (e.g. up-to-the-minute product inventory, prices, availability) * **You need to pass dynamic filters** to your data source based on user input or request parameters * **You’re building preview functionality** for a CMS where editors need to see draft content immediately In contrast, use build-time content collections when: * **Performance is critical** and you want to pre-render data at build time * **Your data is relatively static** (e.g., blog posts, documentation, product descriptions) * **You want to benefit from build-time optimization** and caching * **You need to process MDX** or perform image optimization * **Your data can be fetched once and reused** across multiple builds See the [limitations of experimental live collections](#live-collection-limitations) and [key differences from build-time collections](#differences-from-build-time-collections) for more details on choosing between live and preloaded collections. ## Using live collections [Section titled “Using live collections”](#using-live-collections) You can [create your own live loaders](#creating-a-live-loader) for your data source, or you can use community loaders distributed as npm packages. Here’s how you could use example CMS and e-commerce loaders: src/live.config.ts ```ts import { defineLiveCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { cmsLoader } from '@example/cms-astro-loader'; import { productLoader } from '@example/store-astro-loader'; const articles = defineLiveCollection({ loader: cmsLoader({ apiKey: process.env.CMS_API_KEY, contentType: 'article', }), }); const products = defineLiveCollection({ loader: productLoader({ apiKey: process.env.STORE_API_KEY, }), }); export const collections = { articles, products }; ``` You can then get content from both loaders with a unified API: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveCollection, getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content'; // Use loader-specific filters const { entries: draftArticles } = await getLiveCollection('articles', { status: 'draft', author: 'john-doe', }); // Get a specific product by ID const { entry: product } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.slug); --- ``` ### Error handling [Section titled “Error handling”](#error-handling) Live loaders can fail due to network issues, API errors, or validation problems. The API is designed to make error handling explicit. When you call `getLiveCollection()` or `getLiveEntry()`, the error will be one of: * The error type defined by the loader (if it returned an error) * A `LiveEntryNotFoundError` if the entry was not found * A `LiveCollectionValidationError` if the collection data does not match the expected schema * A `LiveCollectionCacheHintError` if the cache hint is invalid * A `LiveCollectionError` for other errors, such as uncaught errors thrown in the loader These errors have a static `is()` method that you can use to check the type of error at runtime: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveEntry, LiveEntryNotFoundError } from 'astro:content'; const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.id); if (error) { if (LiveEntryNotFoundError.is(error)) { console.error(`Product not found: ${error.message}`); Astro.response.status = 404; } else { console.error(`Error loading product: ${error.message}`); return Astro.redirect('/500'); } } --- ``` ## Creating a live loader [Section titled “Creating a live loader”](#creating-a-live-loader) A live loader is an object with two methods: `loadCollection()` and `loadEntry()`. These methods should handle errors gracefully and return either data or an [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object. The standard pattern is to export a function that returns this loader object, allowing you to pass configuration options like API keys or endpoints. Here’s a basic example: myloader.ts ```ts import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders'; import { fetchFromCMS } from './cms-client.js'; interface Article { id: string; title: string; content: string; author: string; } export function articleLoader(config: { apiKey: string }): LiveLoader<Article> { return { name: 'article-loader', loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => { try { const articles = await fetchFromCMS({ apiKey: config.apiKey, type: 'article', filter, }); return { entries: articles.map((article) => ({ id: article.id, data: article, })), }; } catch (error) { return { error: new Error(`Failed to load articles: ${error.message}`), }; } }, loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => { try { // filter will be { id: "some-id" } when called with a string const article = await fetchFromCMS({ apiKey: config.apiKey, type: 'article', id: filter.id, }); if (!article) { return { error: new Error('Article not found'), }; } return { id: article.id, data: article, }; } catch (error) { return { error: new Error(`Failed to load article: ${error.message}`), }; } }, }; } ``` ### Rendering content [Section titled “Rendering content”](#rendering-content) A loader can add support for directly rendered content by returning [a `rendered` property](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#rendered) in the entry. This allows you to use [the `render()` function and `<Content />` component](/en/guides/content-collections/#rendering-body-content) to render the content directly in your pages. If the loader does not return a `rendered` property for an entry, the `<Content />` component will render nothing. myloader.ts ```ts // ... export function articleLoader(config: { apiKey: string }): LiveLoader<Article> { return { name: 'article-loader', loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => { try { const article = await fetchFromCMS({ apiKey: config.apiKey, type: 'article', id: filter.id, }); return { id: article.id, data: article, rendered: { // Assuming the CMS returns HTML content html: article.htmlContent, }, }; } catch (error) { return { error: new Error(`Failed to load article: ${error.message}`), }; } }, // ... }; } ``` You can then render both content and metadata from live collection entries in pages using the same method as built-time collections. You also have access to any [error returned by the live loader](#error-handling-in-loaders), for example, to rewrite to a 404 page when content cannot be displayed: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveEntry, render } from 'astro:content'; const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('articles', Astro.params.id); if (error) { return Astro.rewrite('/404'); } const { Content } = await render(entry); --- <h1>{entry.data.title}</h1> <Content /> ``` ### Error handling in loaders [Section titled “Error handling in loaders”](#error-handling-in-loaders) Loaders should handle all errors and return an [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) subclass for errors. You can create custom error types and use them for more specific error handling if needed. If an error is thrown in the loader, it will be caught and returned, wrapped in a `LiveCollectionError`. You can also create [custom error types](#custom-error-types) for proper typing. Astro will generate some errors itself, depending on the response from the loader: * If `loadEntry` returns `undefined`, Astro will return a `LiveEntryNotFoundError` to the user. * If a schema is defined for the collection and the data does not match the schema, Astro will return a `LiveCollectionValidationError`. * If the loader returns an invalid cache hint, Astro will return a `LiveCollectionCacheHintError`. The `cacheHint` field is optional, so if you do not have valid data to return, you can simply omit it. my-loader.ts ```ts import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders'; import { MyLoaderError } from './errors.js'; export function myLoader(config): LiveLoader<MyData, undefined, undefined, MyLoaderError> { return { name: 'my-loader', loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => { // Return your custom error type return { error: new MyLoaderError('Failed to load', 'LOAD_ERROR'), }; }, // ... }; } ``` ### Distributing your loader [Section titled “Distributing your loader”](#distributing-your-loader) Loaders can be defined in your site or as a separate npm package. If you want to share your loader with the community, you can [publish it to NPM with the `astro-component` and `astro-loader` keywords](/en/reference/publish-to-npm/#packagejson-data). The loader should export a function that returns the `LiveLoader` object, allowing users to configure it with their own settings. ## Type safety [Section titled “Type safety”](#type-safety) Like regular content collections, live collections can be typed to ensure type safety in your data. [Using Zod schemas](#using-zod-schemas) is supported, but not required to define types for live collections. Unlike preloaded collections defined at build time, live loaders can instead choose to pass generic types to the `LiveLoader` interface. You can define the types for your collection and entry data, as well as custom filter types for querying, and custom error types for error handling. ### Type-safe data [Section titled “Type-safe data”](#type-safe-data) Live loaders can define types for the data they return. This allows TypeScript to provide type checking and autocompletion when working with the data in your components. store-loader.ts ```ts import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders'; import { fetchProduct, fetchCategory, type Product } from './store-client'; export function storeLoader(): LiveLoader<Product> { // ... } ``` When you use `getLiveCollection()` or `getLiveEntry()`, TypeScript will infer the types based on the loader’s definition: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content'; const { entry: product } = await getLiveEntry('products', '123'); // TypeScript knows product.data is of type Product console.log(product?.data.name); --- ``` ### Type-safe filters [Section titled “Type-safe filters”](#type-safe-filters) Live loaders can define custom filter types for both `getLiveCollection()` and `getLiveEntry()`. This enables type-safe querying that matches your API’s capabilities, making it easier for users to discover available filters and ensure they are used correctly. If you include JSDoc comments in your filter types, the user will see these in their IDE as hints when using the loader. store-loader.ts ```ts import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders'; import { fetchProduct, fetchCategory, type Product } from './store-client'; interface CollectionFilter { category?: string; /** Minimum price to filter products */ minPrice?: number; /** Maximum price to filter products */ maxPrice?: number; } interface EntryFilter { /** Alias for `sku` */ id?: string; slug?: string; sku?: string; } export function productLoader(config: { apiKey: string; endpoint: string; }): LiveLoader<Product, EntryFilter, CollectionFilter> { return { name: 'product-loader', loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => { // filter is typed as CollectionFilter const data = await fetchCategory({ apiKey: config.apiKey, category: filter?.category ?? 'all', minPrice: filter?.minPrice, maxPrice: filter?.maxPrice, }); return { entries: data.products.map((product) => ({ id: product.sku, data: product, })), }; }, loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => { // filter is typed as EntryFilter | { id: string } const product = await fetchProduct({ apiKey: config.apiKey, slug: filter.slug, sku: filter.sku || filter.id, }); if (!product) { return { error: new Error('Product not found'), }; } return { id: product.sku, entry: product, }; }, }; } ``` ### Custom error types [Section titled “Custom error types”](#custom-error-types) You can create custom error types for [errors returned by your loader](#error-handling-in-loaders) and pass them as a generic to get proper typing: my-loader.ts ```ts class MyLoaderError extends Error { constructor( message: string, public code?: string ) { super(message); this.name = 'MyLoaderError'; } } export function myLoader(config): LiveLoader<MyData, undefined, undefined, MyLoaderError> { return { name: 'my-loader', loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => { // Return your custom error type return { error: new MyLoaderError('Failed to load', 'LOAD_ERROR'), }; }, // ... }; } ``` When you use `getLiveCollection()` or `getLiveEntry()`, TypeScript will infer the custom error type, allowing you to handle it appropriately: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content'; const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('products', '123'); if (error) { if (error.name === 'MyLoaderError') { console.error(`Loader error: ${error.message} (code: ${error.code})`); } else { console.error(`Unexpected error: ${error.message}`); } return Astro.rewrite('/500'); } --- ``` ## Using Zod schemas [Section titled “Using Zod schemas”](#using-zod-schemas) Just like with build-time collections, you can use [Zod schemas](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-the-collection-schema) with live collections to validate and transform data at runtime. When you define a schema, it takes precedence over [the loader’s types](#type-safe-data) when you query the collection: src/live.config.ts ```ts import { defineLiveCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { z } from 'astro/zod'; import { apiLoader } from './loaders/api-loader'; const products = defineLiveCollection({ loader: apiLoader({ endpoint: process.env.API_URL }), schema: z .object({ id: z.string(), name: z.string(), price: z.number(), // Transform the API's category format category: z.string().transform((str) => str.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')), // Coerce the date to a Date object createdAt: z.coerce.date(), }) .transform((data) => ({ ...data, // Add a formatted price field displayPrice: `$${data.price.toFixed(2)}`, })), }); export const collections = { products }; ``` When using Zod schemas, validation errors are automatically caught and returned as `AstroError` objects: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveEntry, LiveCollectionValidationError } from 'astro:content'; const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('products', '123'); // You can handle validation errors specifically if (LiveCollectionValidationError.is(error)) { console.error(error.message); return Astro.rewrite('/500'); } // TypeScript knows entry.data matches your Zod schema, not the loader's type console.log(entry?.data.displayPrice); // e.g., "$29.99" --- ``` ## Cache hints [Section titled “Cache hints”](#cache-hints) Live loaders can provide cache hints to help with response caching. You can use this data to send HTTP cache headers or otherwise inform your caching strategy. my-loader.ts ```ts import type { LiveLoader } from "astro/loaders"; import { loadStoreProduct, loadStoreProducts, getLastModifiedDate } from "./store"; import type { MyData } from "./types"; export function myLoader(config): LiveLoader<MyData> { return { name: 'cached-loader', loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => { const products = await loadStoreProducts(filter); return { entries: products.map((item) => ({ id: item.id, data: item, // You can optionally provide cache hints for each entry cacheHint: { tags: [`product-${item.id}`, `category-${item.category}`], }, })), cacheHint: { // All fields are optional, and are combined with each entry's cache hints // tags are merged from all entries // lastModified is the most recent lastModified of all entries and the collection lastModified: getLastModifiedDate(products), tags: ['products'], }, }; }, loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => { const item = await loadStoreProduct(filter); return { id: item.id, data: item, cacheHint: { lastModified: new Date(item.lastModified), tags: [`product-${item.id}`, `category-${item.category}`], }, }; }, }; } ``` You can then use these hints in your pages: ```astro --- export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode import { getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content'; const { entry, error, cacheHint } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.id); if (error) { return Astro.redirect('/404'); } // Apply cache hints to response headers if (cacheHint?.tags) { Astro.response.headers.set('Cache-Tag', cacheHint.tags.join(',')); } if (cacheHint?.lastModified) { Astro.response.headers.set('Last-Modified', cacheHint.lastModified.toUTCString()); } --- <h1>{entry.data.name}</h1> <p>{entry.data.description}</p> ``` ## Live collection limitations [Section titled “Live collection limitations”](#live-collection-limitations) Live content collections have some limitations compared to build-time collections: * **No MDX support**: MDX cannot be rendered at runtime * **No image optimization**: Images cannot be processed at runtime * **Performance considerations**: Data is fetched on each request (unless cached) * **No data store persistence**: Data is not saved to the content layer data store ## Differences from build-time collections [Section titled “Differences from build-time collections”](#differences-from-build-time-collections) Live collections use a different API than current preloaded content collections. Key differences include: 1. **Execution time**: Run at request time instead of build time 2. **Configuration file**: Use `src/live.config.ts` instead of `src/content.config.ts` 3. **Collection definition**: Use `defineLiveCollection()` instead of `defineCollection()` 4. **Loader API**: Implement `loadCollection` and `loadEntry` methods instead of the `load` method 5. **Data return**: Return data directly instead of storing in the data store 6. **User-facing functions**: Use `getLiveCollection`/`getLiveEntry` instead of `getCollection`/`getEntry` For a complete overview and to give feedback on this experimental API, see the [Live Content collections RFC](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/blob/feat/live-loaders/proposals/0055-live-content-loaders.md).

# Experimental preserve scripts order

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.5.0` Renders multiple `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the same order as they were declared in the source code. To enable this behavior, add the `experimental.preserveScriptOrder` feature flag to your Astro config: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ + experimental: { + preserveScriptOrder: true + } }) ``` ## Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) This experimental flag requires no specific usage and only affects the order in which Astro renders your styles and scripts. When rendering multiple `<style>` and `<script>` tags on the same page, Astro currently reverses their order in your generated HTML output. This can give unexpected results, for example, CSS styles being overridden by earlier defined style tags when your site is built. This experimental flag instead renders `<script>` and `<style>` tags in the order they are defined. For example, the following component has two `<style>` tags and two `<script>` tags: src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro <p>I am a component</p> <style> body { background: red; } </style> <style> body { background: yellow; } </style> <script> console.log("hello") </script> <script> console.log("world!") </script> ``` After compiling, Astro’s default behavior will create an inline style where `yellow` appears first, and then `red`. This means the `red` background is applied. Similarly with the two scripts, the word `world!` is logged first, and then `hello` second: ```css body {background:#ff0} body {background:red} ``` ```js console.log("world!") console.log("hello") ``` When `experimental.preserveScriptOrder` is set to `true`, the rendering order of `<style>` and `<script>` tags matches the order in which they are written. For the same example component, the style generated `red` appears first, and then `yellow`; as for the scripts, `hello` is logged first, and then `world!`: ```css body {background:red} body {background:#ff0} ``` ```js console.log("hello") console.log("world!") ``` In a future major version, Astro will preserve style and script order by default, but you can opt in to the future behavior early using the `experimental.preserveScriptOrder` flag.

# Experimental private meta environment variables inlining

**Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.13.0` Astro allows you to configure a [type-safe schema for your environment variables](/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables), and converts variables imported via `astro:env` into the expected type. This is the recommended way to use environment variables in Astro, as it allows you to easily see and manage whether your variables are public or secret, available on the client or only on the server at build time, and the data type of your values. However, you can still access your environment variables through `process.env` as well as `import.meta.env` directly if needed. This was the only way to use environment variables in Astro before `astro:env` was added in Astro 5.0, and its handling of `import.meta.env` includes some logic that was intended for earlier versions of Astro that is no longer necessary. The `experimental.staticImportMetaEnv` flag updates the behavior when accessing `import.meta.env` directly to align with [Vite’s handling of environment variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables) and ensures that `import.meta.env` values are always inlined. Currently, non-public environment variables are replaced by a reference to `process.env`. Additionally, Astro may also convert the value type of your environment variables used through `import.meta.env`, which can prevent access to some values such as the strings `"true"` (which is converted to a boolean value), and `"1"` (which is converted to a number). The `experimental.staticImportMetaEnv` flag simplifies Astro’s default behavior, making it easier to understand and use. Astro will no longer replace any `import.meta.env` environment variables with a `process.env` call, nor will it coerce values. To enable this feature, add the experimental flag in your Astro config: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ + experimental: { + staticImportMetaEnv: true, + } }) ``` ## Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) Enabling this experimental flag will no longer convert string values into booleans or numbers, nor turn `import.meta.env` values into `process.env` calls. This aligns `import.meta.env`’s behavior in Astro with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables). In a future major version, Astro will switch to this behavior by default, but you can opt in to the future behavior early using the `experimental.staticImportMetaEnv` flag and, if necessary, [updating your project](#updating-your-project) accordingly. ### Updating your project [Section titled “Updating your project”](#updating-your-project) If you were relying on coercion, you may need to update your project code to apply it manually: src/components/MyComponent.astro ```diff -const enabled: boolean = import.meta.env.ENABLED; +const enabled: boolean = import.meta.env.ENABLED === "true"; ``` If you were relying on the transformation into `process.env`, you may need to update your project code to apply it manually: src/components/MyComponent.astro ```diff -const enabled: boolean = import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD; +const enabled: boolean = process.env.DB_PASSWORD; ``` You may also need to update types: src/env.d.ts ```diff interface ImportMetaEnv { readonly PUBLIC_POKEAPI: string; -readonly DB_PASSWORD: string; -readonly ENABLED: boolean; +readonly ENABLED: string; } interface ImportMeta { readonly env: ImportMetaEnv; } +namespace NodeJS { +interface ProcessEnv { + DB_PASSWORD: string; + } +} ``` If you need more control over environment variables in Astro, we recommend you use [`astro:env`](/en/guides/environment-variables/).

# Experimental SVG optimization

**Type:** `boolean | object`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.16.0` This experimental feature enables automatic optimization of your [SVG components](/en/guides/images/#svg-components) using [SVGO](https://svgo.dev/) during build time. When enabled, your imported SVG files used as components will be optimized for smaller file sizes and better performance while maintaining visual quality. This can significantly reduce the size of your SVG assets by removing unnecessary metadata, comments, and redundant code. To enable this feature with default settings, set it to `true` in your Astro config: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from "astro/config" export default defineConfig({ experimental: { + svgo: true } }) ``` ## Usage [Section titled “Usage”](#usage) No change to using SVG components is required to take advantage of this feature. With experimental `svgo` enabled, all your SVG component import files will be automatically optimized: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import Logo from '../assets/logo.svg'; --- <Logo /> ``` The SVG will be optimized during the build process, resulting in smaller file sizes in your production build. Note that this optimization applies to every SVG component import in your project. It is not possible to opt out on a per-component basis. ## Configuration [Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration) You can pass a [SVGO configuration object](https://github.com/svg/svgo/blob/66d503a48c6c95661726262a3068053c429b06a9/lib/types.ts#L335) to customize optimization behavior: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { svgo: { plugins: [ 'preset-default', { name: 'removeViewBox', active: false } ] } } }) ``` ### `plugins` [Section titled “plugins”](#plugins) **Type:** `Array<string | PluginConfig>`\ **Default:** `[]` An array of [SVGO plugins](https://svgo.dev/docs/plugins/) that will be used to optimize your SVG component imports. This can include any plugins by ID name, including SVGO’s `preset-default` collection of plugins. A plugin can optionally be passed as an object including both its `name` and `active` status, to enable or disable as necessary. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { svgo: { plugins: [ 'preset-default', { name: 'removeViewBox', active: false } ] } } }) ``` ### Other configuration options [Section titled “Other configuration options”](#other-configuration-options) You can also pass [other SVGO configuration options](https://github.com/svg/svgo/blob/66d503a48c6c95661726262a3068053c429b06a9/lib/types.ts#L335), such as `floatPrecision` and `multipass`, directly to your config object: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { svgo: { floatPrecision: 2, multipass: true } } }) ``` ## Common use cases [Section titled “Common use cases”](#common-use-cases) SVGO provides an extensive [default plugin list](https://svgo.dev/docs/preset-default/) with opinionated optimizations that is more convenient than adding each plugin individually. However, you may need to customize it further for your needs. For example, it may remove items or clean up too aggressively for your situation. ### Preserve specific attributes [Section titled “Preserve specific attributes”](#preserve-specific-attributes) You may want to preserve certain SVG attributes, such as the `viewBox`, that SVGO removes by default: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { svgo: { plugins: [ 'preset-default', { name: 'removeViewBox', active: false // Preserve viewBox attribute } ] } } }) ``` ### Remove specific elements [Section titled “Remove specific elements”](#remove-specific-elements) You can configure plugins to remove specific unwanted elements like metadata or hidden layers. Note that many plugins are already included in `preset-default`, so you typically only need to configure their behavior: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { svgo: { plugins: [ 'preset-default', { name: 'removeMetadata', active: true } ] } } }) ``` ### Custom precision [Section titled “Custom precision”](#custom-precision) Control the precision of numeric values in path data: astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ experimental: { svgo: { floatPrecision: 2 } } }) ``` ## How it works [Section titled “How it works”](#how-it-works) SVG optimization happens during the build process, not at runtime: * In **development mode**, SVG files are not optimized to ensure faster rebuild times and a smoother development experience. * In **production builds**, all imported SVG files are optimized once during the build process, resulting in smaller file sizes. * There is **no runtime overhead** - optimized SVGs are served as pre-processed static assets. While the optimization process may slightly increase your build times, the result is smaller file sizes and faster page loads for your users. ## Further reading [Section titled “Further reading”](#further-reading) * [SVGO documentation](https://svgo.dev/)

# Image Service API

`astro:assets` was designed to make it easy for any image optimization service to build a service on top of Astro. ## What is an Image Service? [Section titled “What is an Image Service?”](#what-is-an-image-service) Astro provides two types of image services: Local and External. * **Local services** handle image transformations directly at build for static sites, or at runtime both in development mode and for on-demand rendering. These are often wrappers around libraries like Sharp, ImageMagick, or Squoosh. In dev mode and in production routes rendered on demand, local services use an API endpoint to do the transformation. * **External services** point to URLs and can add support for services such as Cloudinary, Vercel, or any [RIAPI](https://github.com/riapi/riapi)-compliant server. ## Building using the Image Services API [Section titled “Building using the Image Services API”](#building-using-the-image-services-api) Service definitions take the shape of an exported default object with various required methods (“hooks”). External services provide a `getURL()` that points to the `src` of the output `<img>` tag. Local services provide a `transform()` method to perform transformations on your image, and `getURL()` and `parseURL()` methods to use an endpoint for dev mode and when rendered on demand. Both types of services can provide `getHTMLAttributes()` to determine the other attributes of the output `<img>` and `validateOptions()` to validate and augment the passed options. ### External Services [Section titled “External Services”](#external-services) An external service points to a remote URL to be used as the `src` attribute of the final `<img>` tag. This remote URL is responsible for downloading, transforming, and returning the image. ```ts import type { ExternalImageService, ImageTransform, AstroConfig } from "astro"; const service: ExternalImageService = { validateOptions(options: ImageTransform, imageConfig: AstroConfig['image']) { const serviceConfig = imageConfig.service.config; // Enforce the user set max width. if (options.width && options.width > serviceConfig.maxWidth) { console.warn(`Image width ${options.width} exceeds max width ${serviceConfig.maxWidth}. Falling back to max width.`); options.width = serviceConfig.maxWidth; } return options; }, getURL(options, imageConfig) { return `https://mysupercdn.com/${options.src}?q=${options.quality}&w=${options.width}&h=${options.height}`; }, getHTMLAttributes(options, imageConfig) { const { src, format, quality, ...attributes } = options; return { ...attributes, loading: options.loading ?? 'lazy', decoding: options.decoding ?? 'async', }; } }; export default service; ``` ### Local Services [Section titled “Local Services”](#local-services) To create your own local service, you can point to the [built-in endpoint](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/src/assets/endpoint/generic.ts) (`/_image`), or you can additionally create your own endpoint that can call the service’s methods. ```ts import type { ImageTransform, LocalImageService, AstroConfig } from "astro"; const service: LocalImageService<AstroConfig["image"]> = { getURL(options: ImageTransform, imageConfig) { const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(); searchParams.append('href', typeof options.src === "string" ? options.src : options.src.src); options.width && searchParams.append('w', options.width.toString()); options.height && searchParams.append('h', options.height.toString()); options.quality && searchParams.append('q', options.quality.toString()); options.format && searchParams.append('f', options.format); return `/my_custom_endpoint_that_transforms_images?${searchParams}`; // Or use the built-in endpoint, which will call your parseURL and transform functions: // return `/_image?${searchParams}`; }, parseURL(url: URL, imageConfig) { const params = url.searchParams; return { src: params.get('href')!, width: params.has('w') ? parseInt(params.get('w')!) : undefined, height: params.has('h') ? parseInt(params.get('h')!) : undefined, format: params.get('f'), quality: params.get('q'), }; }, async transform(inputBuffer: Uint8Array, options: { src: string, [key: string]: any }, imageConfig) { const { buffer } = await mySuperLibraryThatEncodesImages(options); return { data: buffer, format: options.format, }; }, getHTMLAttributes(options, imageConfig) { let targetWidth = options.width; let targetHeight = options.height; if (typeof options.src === "object") { const aspectRatio = options.src.width / options.src.height; if (targetHeight && !targetWidth) { targetWidth = Math.round(targetHeight * aspectRatio); } else if (targetWidth && !targetHeight) { targetHeight = Math.round(targetWidth / aspectRatio); } } const { src, width, height, format, quality, ...attributes } = options; return { ...attributes, width: targetWidth, height: targetHeight, loading: attributes.loading ?? 'lazy', decoding: attributes.decoding ?? 'async', }; }, propertiesToHash: ['src', 'width', 'height', 'format', 'quality'], }; export default service; ``` At build time for static sites and pre-rendered routes, both `<Image />` and `getImage(options)` call the `transform()` function. They pass options either through component attributes or an `options` argument, respectively. The transformed images will be built to a `dist/_astro` folder. Their file names will contain a hash of the properties passed to `propertiesToHash`. This property is optional and will default to `['src', 'width', 'height', 'format', 'quality']`. If your custom image service has more options that change the generated images, add these to the array. In dev mode and when using an adapter to render on demand, Astro doesn’t know ahead of time which images need to be optimized. Astro uses a GET endpoint (by default, `/_image`) to process the images at runtime. `<Image />` and `getImage()` pass their options to `getURL()`, which will return the endpoint URL. Then, the endpoint calls `parseURL()` and passes the resulting properties to `transform()`. #### getConfiguredImageService & imageConfig [Section titled “getConfiguredImageService & imageConfig”](#getconfiguredimageservice--imageconfig) If you implement your own endpoint as an Astro endpoint, you can use [`getConfiguredImageService`](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#getconfiguredimageservice) and [`imageConfig`](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#imageconfig) to call your service’s `parseURL` and `transform` methods and provide the image config. To access the image service config ([`image.service.config`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imageservice)), you can use `imageConfig.service.config`. src/api/my\_custom\_endpoint\_that\_transforms\_images.ts ```ts import type { APIRoute } from "astro"; import { getConfiguredImageService, imageConfig } from 'astro:assets'; export const GET: APIRoute = async ({ request }) => { const imageService = await getConfiguredImageService(); const imageTransform = imageService.parseURL(new URL(request.url), imageConfig); // ... fetch the image from imageTransform.src and store it in inputBuffer const { data, format } = await imageService.transform(inputBuffer, imageTransform, imageConfig); return new Response(data, { status: 200, headers: { 'Content-Type': mime.getType(format) || '' } } ); } ``` [See the built-in endpoint](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/src/assets/endpoint/generic.ts) for a full example. ## Hooks [Section titled “Hooks”](#hooks) ### `getURL()` [Section titled “getURL()”](#geturl) **Type:** `(options: ImageTransform, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’]) => string | Promise<string>` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.0` **Required for local and external services** For local services, this hook returns the URL of the endpoint that generates your image (for on-demand rendering and in dev mode). It is unused during build. The local endpoint that `getURL()` points to may call both `parseURL()` and `transform()`. For external services, this hook returns the final URL of the image. For both types of services, `options` are the properties passed by the user as attributes of the `<Image />` component or as options to `getImage()`. ### `parseURL()` [Section titled “parseURL()”](#parseurl) **Type:** `(url: URL, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’]) => { src: string, [key: string]: any } | undefined | Promise<{ src: string, [key: string]: any }> | Promise<undefined>` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.0` **Required for local services only; unavailable for external services** This hook parses the generated URLs by `getURL()` back into an object with the different properties to be used by `transform` (for on-demand rendering and in dev mode). It is unused during build. ### `transform()` [Section titled “transform()”](#transform) **Type:** `(inputBuffer: Uint8Array, options: { src: string, [key: string]: any }, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’]) => Promise<{ data: Uint8Array; format: ImageOutputFormat }>` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.0` **Required for local services only; unavailable for external services** This hook transforms and returns the image and is called during the build to create the final asset files. You must return a `format` to ensure that the proper MIME type is served to users for on-demand rendering and development mode. ### `getHTMLAttributes()` [Section titled “getHTMLAttributes()”](#gethtmlattributes) **Type:** `(options: ImageTransform, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’] ) => Record<string, any> | Promise<Record<string, any>>` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.0` **Optional for both local and external services** This hook returns all additional attributes used to render the image as HTML, based on the parameters passed by the user (`options`). ### `getSrcSet()` [Section titled “getSrcSet()”](#getsrcset) **Type:** `(options: ImageTransform, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’] ) => UnresolvedSrcSetValue[] | Promise<UnresolvedSrcSetValue[]>` **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` **Optional for both local and external services.** This hook generates multiple variants of the specified image, for example, to generate a `srcset` attribute on an `<img>` or `<picture>`’s `source`. This hook returns an array of objects with the following properties: ```ts export type UnresolvedSrcSetValue = { transform: ImageTransform; descriptor?: string; attributes?: Record<string, any>; }; ``` ### `validateOptions()` [Section titled “validateOptions()”](#validateoptions) **Type:** `(options: ImageTransform, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’] ) => ImageTransform | Promise<ImageTransform>` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.4` **Optional for both local and external services** This hook allows you to validate and augment the options passed by the user. This is useful for setting default options, or telling the user that a parameter is required. [See how `validateOptions()` is used in Astro built-in services](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/0ab6bad7dffd413c975ab00e545f8bc150f6a92f/packages/astro/src/assets/services/service.ts#L124). ## User configuration [Section titled “User configuration”](#user-configuration) Configure the image service to use in `astro.config.mjs`. The config takes the following form: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"; export default defineConfig({ image: { service: { entrypoint: "your-entrypoint", // 'astro/assets/services/sharp' | string, config: { // ... service-specific config. Optional. } } }, }); ``` ## Typing custom image service props [Section titled “Typing custom image service props”](#typing-custom-image-service-props) **Added in:** `astro@5.16.6` If your image service supports additional props in Astro’s `<Image>` component, `<Picture>` component, or the `getImage()` function, you can add types for these by extending the `Astro.CustomImageProps` interface. For example, to add a custom `blur` prop that your image service supports: ```ts declare namespace Astro { interface CustomImageProps { /** Apply a Gaussian blur with this radius to the image. */ blur?: number; } } ``` You can expose these types to users by making your image service an [Astro integration](/en/reference/integrations-reference/) and using the [`injectTypes()`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#injecttypes-option) helper. Then, users will be able to get autocomplete and type safety for your custom props: ```astro <Image blur="yes" src={myPhoto} /> // ^^^^^^^^^^ // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number | undefined'. ```

# Astro Integration API

**Astro Integrations** add new functionality and behaviors for your project with only a few lines of code. This reference page is for anyone writing their own integration. To learn how to use an integration in your project, check out our [Using Integrations](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) guide instead. ## Examples [Section titled “Examples”](#examples) The official Astro integrations can act as reference for you as you go to build your own integrations. * **Renderers:** [`svelte`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/), [`react`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/), [`preact`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/preact/), [`vue`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/), [`solid`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/solid-js/) * **Libraries:** [`partytown`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/partytown/) * **Features:** [`sitemap`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) ## Quick API Reference [Section titled “Quick API Reference”](#quick-api-reference) ```ts interface AstroIntegration { name: string; hooks: { 'astro:config:setup'?: (options: { config: AstroConfig; command: 'dev' | 'build' | 'preview' | 'sync'; isRestart: boolean; updateConfig: (newConfig: DeepPartial<AstroConfig>) => AstroConfig; addRenderer: (renderer: AstroRenderer) => void; addWatchFile: (path: URL | string) => void; addClientDirective: (directive: ClientDirectiveConfig) => void; addMiddleware: (middleware: AstroIntegrationMiddleware) => void; addDevToolbarApp: (entrypoint: DevToolbarAppEntry) => void; injectScript: (stage: InjectedScriptStage, content: string) => void; injectRoute: (injectedRoute: InjectedRoute) => void; createCodegenDir: () => URL; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:route:setup'?: (options: { route: RouteOptions; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:routes:resolved'?: (options: { routes: IntegrationResolvedRoute[]; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:config:done'?: (options: { config: AstroConfig; setAdapter: (adapter: AstroAdapter) => void; injectTypes: (injectedType: InjectedType) => URL; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; buildOutput: 'static' | 'server'; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:server:setup'?: (options: { server: vite.ViteDevServer; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; toolbar: ReturnType<typeof getToolbarServerCommunicationHelpers>; refreshContent?: (options: RefreshContentOptions) => Promise<void>; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:server:start'?: (options: { address: AddressInfo; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:server:done'?: (options: { logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:build:start'?: (options: { logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:build:setup'?: (options: { vite: vite.InlineConfig; pages: Map<string, PageBuildData>; target: 'client' | 'server'; updateConfig: (newConfig: vite.InlineConfig) => void; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:build:ssr'?: (options: { manifest: SerializedSSRManifest; entryPoints: Map<IntegrationRouteData, URL>; middlewareEntryPoint: URL | undefined; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:build:generated'?: (options: { dir: URL; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; 'astro:build:done'?: (options: { pages: { pathname: string }[]; dir: URL; assets: Map<string, URL[]>; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; // ... any custom hooks from integrations }; } ``` ## Hooks [Section titled “Hooks”](#hooks) Astro provides hooks that integrations can implement to execute during certain parts of Astro’s lifecycle. Astro hooks are defined in the `IntegrationHooks` interface, which is part of the global `Astro` namespace. Each hook has a [`logger` option](#astrointegrationlogger) that allows you to use the Astro logger to write logs. The following hooks are built in to Astro: ### `astro:config:setup` [Section titled “astro:config:setup”](#astroconfigsetup) **Next hook:** [`astro:route:setup`](#astroroutesetup) **When:** On initialization, before either the [Vite](https://vite.dev/config/) or [Astro config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/) have resolved. **Why:** To extend the project config. This includes updating the [Astro config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/), applying [Vite plugins](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html), adding component renderers, and injecting scripts onto the page. ```ts 'astro:config:setup'?: (options: { config: AstroConfig; command: 'dev' | 'build' | 'preview' | 'sync'; isRestart: boolean; updateConfig: (newConfig: DeepPartial<AstroConfig>) => AstroConfig; addRenderer: (renderer: AstroRenderer) => void; addClientDirective: (directive: ClientDirectiveConfig) => void; addMiddleware: (middleware: AstroIntegrationMiddleware) => void; addDevToolbarApp: (entrypoint: DevToolbarAppEntry) => void; addWatchFile: (path: URL | string) => void; injectScript: (stage: InjectedScriptStage, content: string) => void; injectRoute: (injectedRoute: InjectedRoute) => void; createCodegenDir: () => URL; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `config` option [Section titled “config option”](#config-option) **Type:** `AstroConfig` A read-only copy of the user-supplied [Astro config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/). This is resolved *before* any other integrations have run. If you need a copy of the config after all integrations have completed their config updates, [see the `astro:config:done` hook](#astroconfigdone). #### `command` option [Section titled “command option”](#command-option) **Type:** `'dev' | 'build' | 'preview' | 'sync'` * `dev` - Project is executed with `astro dev` * `build` - Project is executed with `astro build` * `preview` - Project is executed with `astro preview` * `sync` - Project is executed with `astro sync` #### `isRestart` option [Section titled “isRestart option”](#isrestart-option) **Type:** `boolean` **Added in:** `astro@1.5.0` `false` when the dev server starts, `true` when a reload is triggered. Useful to detect when this function is called more than once. #### `updateConfig()` option [Section titled “updateConfig() option”](#updateconfig-option) **Type:** `(newConfig: DeepPartial<AstroConfig>) => AstroConfig;` A callback function to update the user-supplied [Astro config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/). Any config you provide **will be merged with the user config + other integration config updates,** so you are free to omit keys! For example, say you need to supply a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) plugin to the user’s project: ```js import bananaCSS from '@vitejs/official-banana-css-plugin'; export default { name: 'banana-css-integration', hooks: { 'astro:config:setup': ({ updateConfig }) => { updateConfig({ vite: { plugins: [bananaCSS()], } }) } } } ``` #### `addRenderer()` option [Section titled “addRenderer() option”](#addrenderer-option) **Type:** `(renderer: AstroRenderer) => void;`\ **Examples:** [`svelte`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/svelte/src/index.ts), [`react`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/react/src/index.ts), [`preact`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/preact/src/index.ts), [`vue`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/vue/src/index.ts), [`solid`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/solid/src/index.ts) A callback function to add a component framework renderer (i.e. React, Vue, Svelte, etc). You can browse the examples and type definition above for more advanced options, but here are the 2 main options to be aware of: * `clientEntrypoint` - path to a file that executes on the client whenever your component is used. This is mainly for rendering or hydrating your component with JS. * `serverEntrypoint` - path to a file that executes during server-side requests or static builds whenever your component is used. These should render components to static markup, with hooks for hydration where applicable. [React’s `renderToString` callback](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString) is a classic example. **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The functions `clientEntrypoint` and `serverEntrypoint` accept a `URL`. #### `addWatchFile()` option [Section titled “addWatchFile() option”](#addwatchfile-option) **Type:** `(path: URL | string) => void` **Added in:** `astro@1.5.0` If your integration depends on some configuration file that Vite doesn’t watch and/or needs a full dev server restart to take effect, add it with `addWatchFile()`. Whenever that file changes, the Astro dev server will be reloaded (you can check when a reload happens with [`isRestart`](#isrestart-option)). Example usage: ```js // Must be an absolute path! addWatchFile('/home/user/.../my-config.json'); addWatchFile(new URL('./ec.config.mjs', config.root)); ``` #### `addClientDirective()` option [Section titled “addClientDirective() option”](#addclientdirective-option) **Type:** `(directive: ClientDirectiveConfig) => void;` **Added in:** `astro@2.6.0` Adds a [custom client directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#custom-client-directives) to be used in `.astro` files. Note that directive entrypoints are only bundled through esbuild and should be kept small so they don’t slow down component hydration. Example usage: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; import clickDirective from './astro-click-directive/register.js' // https://astro.build/config export default defineConfig({ integrations: [ clickDirective() ], }); ``` astro-click-directive/register.js ```js /** * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration} */ export default () => ({ name: "client:click", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addClientDirective }) => { addClientDirective({ name: "click", entrypoint: "./astro-click-directive/click.js", }); }, }, }); ``` astro-click-directive/click.js ```js /** * Hydrate on first click on the window * @type {import('astro').ClientDirective} */ export default (load, opts, el) => { window.addEventListener('click', async () => { const hydrate = await load() await hydrate() }, { once: true }) } ``` You can also add types for the directives in your library’s type definition file: astro-click-directive/index.d.ts ```ts import 'astro' declare module 'astro' { interface AstroClientDirectives { 'client:click'?: boolean } } ``` #### `addDevToolbarApp()` option [Section titled “addDevToolbarApp() option”](#adddevtoolbarapp-option) **Type:** `(entrypoint: DevToolbarAppEntry) => void;` **Added in:** `astro@3.4.0` Adds a [custom dev toolbar app](/en/reference/dev-toolbar-app-reference/). Example usage: astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; import devToolbarIntegration from './astro-dev-toolbar-app/integration.js' // https://astro.build/config export default defineConfig({ integrations: [ devToolbarIntegration() ], }); ``` astro-dev-toolbar-app/integration.js ```js /** * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration} */ export default () => ({ name: "dev-toolbar-app", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addDevToolbarApp }) => { addDevToolbarApp({ entrypoint: "./astro-dev-toolbar-app/plugin.js", id: "my-plugin", name: "My Plugin" }); }, }, }); ``` astro-dev-toolbar-app/plugin.js ```js /** * @type {import('astro').DevToolbarApp} */ export default { id: "my-plugin", name: "My Plugin", icon: "<svg>...</svg>", init() { console.log("I'm a dev toolbar app!") }, }; ``` #### `addMiddleware()` option [Section titled “addMiddleware() option”](#addmiddleware-option) **Type:** `(middleware: AstroIntegrationMiddleware) => void;` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` Adds [middleware](/en/guides/middleware/) to run on each request. Takes the `entrypoint` module that contains the middleware, and an `order` to specify whether it should run before (`pre`) other middleware or after (`post`). @my-package/integration.js ```js /** * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration} */ export default () => ({ name: "my-middleware-package", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addMiddleware }) => { addMiddleware({ entrypoint: '@my-package/middleware', order: 'pre' }); }, }, }); ``` Middleware is defined in a package with an [`onRequest()` function](/en/reference/modules/astro-middleware/#onrequest), as with user-defined middleware. @my-package/middleware.js ```js import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { if(context.url.pathname === '/some-test-path') { return Response.json({ ok: true }); } return next(); }); ``` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The function also accepts a `URL` for `entrypoint`: @my-package/integration.js ```diff /** * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration} */ export default () => ({ name: "my-middleware-package", hooks: { "astro:config:setup": ({ addMiddleware }) => { addMiddleware({ + entrypoint: new URL('./middleware.js', import.meta.url), order: 'pre' }); }, }, }); ``` #### `injectRoute()` option [Section titled “injectRoute() option”](#injectroute-option) **Type:** `({ pattern: string; entrypoint: string | URL; prerender?: boolean }) => void;` A callback function to inject routes into an Astro project. Injected routes can be [`.astro` pages](/en/basics/astro-pages/) or [`.js` and `.ts` route handlers](/en/guides/endpoints/#static-file-endpoints). `injectRoute()` takes an object with a `pattern` and an `entrypoint`. * `pattern` - where the route should be output in the browser, for example `/foo/bar`. A `pattern` can use Astro’s filepath syntax for denoting dynamic routes, for example `/foo/[bar]` or `/foo/[...bar]`. Note that a file extension is **not** needed in the `pattern`. * `entrypoint` - a bare module specifier pointing towards the `.astro` page or `.js`/`.ts` route handler that handles the route denoted in the `pattern`. * `prerender` - a boolean to set if Astro can’t detect your `prerender` export. ##### Example usage [Section titled “Example usage”](#example-usage) ```js injectRoute({ // Use Astro’s pattern syntax for dynamic routes. pattern: '/subfolder/[dynamic]', // Use relative path syntax for a local route. entrypoint: './src/dynamic-page.astro', // Use only if Astro can't detect your prerender export prerender: false }); ``` For an integration designed to be installed in other projects, use its package name to refer to the route entrypoint. The following example shows a package published to npm as `@fancy/dashboard` injecting a dashboard route: ```js injectRoute({ pattern: '/fancy-dashboard', entrypoint: '@fancy/dashboard/dashboard.astro' }); ``` When publishing your package (`@fancy/dashboard`, in this case) to npm, you must export `dashboard.astro` in your `package.json`: package.json ```json { "name": "@fancy/dashboard", // ... "exports": { "./dashboard.astro": "./dashboard.astro" } } ``` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The function also accepts a `URL` for `entrypoint`: ```js injectRoute({ pattern: '/fancy-dashboard', entrypoint: new URL('./dashboard.astro', import.meta.url) }); ``` #### `injectScript()` option [Section titled “injectScript() option”](#injectscript-option) **Type:** `(stage: InjectedScriptStage, content: string) => void;` A callback function to inject a string of JavaScript content onto every page. The **`stage`** denotes how this script (the `content`) should be inserted. Some stages allow inserting scripts without modification, while others allow optimization during [Vite’s bundling step](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html): * `"head-inline"`: Injected into a script tag in the `<head>` of every page. **Not** optimized or resolved by Vite. * `"before-hydration"`: Imported client-side, before the hydration script runs. Optimized and resolved by Vite. * `"page"`: Similar to `head-inline`, except that the injected snippet is handled by Vite and bundled with any other `<script>` tags defined inside of Astro components on the page. The script will be loaded with a `<script type="module">` in the final page output, optimized and resolved by Vite. * `"page-ssr"`: Imported as a separate module in the frontmatter of every Astro page component. Because this stage imports your script, the `Astro` global is not available and your script will only be run once when the `import` is first evaluated. The main use for the `page-ssr` stage is injecting a CSS `import` into every page to be optimized and resolved by Vite: ```js injectScript('page-ssr', 'import "global-styles.css";'); ``` #### `createCodegenDir()` [Section titled “createCodegenDir()”](#createcodegendir) **Type:** `() => URL;` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A function that creates the `<root>/.astro/integrations/<normalized_integration_name>` folder and returns its path. It allows you to have a dedicated folder, avoiding conflicts with another integration or Astro itself. This directory is created by calling this function so it’s safe to write files to it directly: my-integration.ts ```ts import { writeFileSync } from 'node:fs' const integration = { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:config:setup': ({ createCodegenDir }) => { const codegenDir = createCodegenDir() writeFileSync(new URL('cache.json', codegenDir), '{}', 'utf-8') } } } ``` ### `astro:route:setup` [Section titled “astro:route:setup”](#astroroutesetup) **Added in:** `astro@4.14.0` **Previous hook:** [`astro:config:setup`](#astroconfigsetup) **Next hook:** [`astro:routes:resolved`](#astroroutesresolved) **When:** In `astro build`, before bundling starts. In `astro dev`, while building the module graph and on every change to a file based route (added/removed/updated). **Why:** To set options for a route at build or request time, such as enabling [on-demand server rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#enabling-on-demand-rendering). ```js 'astro:route:setup'?: (options: { route: RouteOptions; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `route` option [Section titled “route option”](#route-option) **Type:** `{ readonly component: string; prerender?: boolean; }` An object with a `component` property to identify the route and the following additional values to allow you to configure the generated route: `prerender`. ##### `route.component` [Section titled “route.component”](#routecomponent) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@4.14.0` The `component` property indicates the entrypoint that will be rendered on the route. You can access this value before the routes are built to configure on-demand server rendering for that page. ##### `route.prerender` [Section titled “route.prerender”](#routeprerender) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `undefined` **Added in:** `astro@4.14.0` The `prerender` property is used to configure [on-demand server rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#enabling-on-demand-rendering) for a route. If the route file contains an explicit `export const prerender` value, the value will be used as the default instead of `undefined`. astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ integrations: [setPrerender()], }); function setPrerender() { return { name: 'set-prerender', hooks: { 'astro:route:setup': ({ route }) => { if (route.component.endsWith('/blog/[slug].astro')) { route.prerender = true; } }, }, }; } ``` If the final value after running all the hooks is `undefined`, the route will fall back to a prerender default based on the [`output` option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#output): prerendered for `static` mode, and on-demand rendered for `server` mode. ### `astro:routes:resolved` [Section titled “astro:routes:resolved”](#astroroutesresolved) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` **Previous hook:** [`astro:route:setup`](#astroroutesetup) **Next hook:** [`astro:config:done`](#astroconfigdone) (only during setup) **When:** In `astro dev`, it also runs on every change to a file based route (added/removed/updated). **Why:** To access routes and their metadata ```js 'astro:routes:resolved'?: (options: { routes: IntegrationResolvedRoute[]; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `routes` option [Section titled “routes option”](#routes-option) **Type:** [`IntegrationResolvedRoute[]`](#integrationresolvedroute) A list of all routes with their associated metadata. Example use: my-integration.mjs ```js const integration = () => { return { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:routes:resolved': ({ routes }) => { const projectRoutes = routes.filter(r => r.origin === 'project').map(r => r.pattern) console.log(projectRoutes) }, } } } ``` ### `astro:config:done` [Section titled “astro:config:done”](#astroconfigdone) **Previous hook:** [`astro:routes:resolved`](#astroroutesresolved) **Next hook:** [`astro:server:setup`](#astroserversetup) when running in “dev” mode, or [`astro:build:start`](#astrobuildstart) during production builds **When:** After the Astro config has resolved and other integrations have run their `astro:config:setup` hooks. **Why:** To retrieve the final config for use in other hooks. ```js 'astro:config:done'?: (options: { config: AstroConfig; setAdapter: (adapter: AstroAdapter) => void; injectTypes: (injectedType: InjectedType) => URL; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; buildOutput: 'static' | 'server'; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `config` option [Section titled “config option”](#config-option-1) **Type:** `AstroConfig` A read-only copy of the user-supplied [Astro config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/). This is resolved *after* other integrations have run. #### `setAdapter()` option [Section titled “setAdapter() option”](#setadapter-option) **Type:** `(adapter: AstroAdapter) => void;` Makes the integration an adapter. Read more in the [adapter API](/en/reference/adapter-reference/). #### `injectTypes()` option [Section titled “injectTypes() option”](#injecttypes-option) **Type:** `(injectedType: { filename: string; content: string }) => URL` **Added in:** `astro@4.14.0` Allows you to inject types into your user’s project by adding a new `*.d.ts` file. The `filename` property will be used to generate a file at `/.astro/integrations/<normalized_integration_name>/<normalized_filename>.d.ts` and must end with `".d.ts"`. The `content` property will create the body of the file and must be valid TypeScript. Additionally, `injectTypes()` returns a URL to the normalized path so you can overwrite its content later on, or manipulate it in any way you want. ```js const path = injectTypes({ filename: "types.d.ts", content: "declare module 'virtual:integration' {}" }) console.log(path) // URL ``` #### `buildOutput` option [Section titled “buildOutput option”](#buildoutput-option) **Type:** `'static' | 'server'` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Allows you to adapt the logic of your integration depending on the user’s project output. ### `astro:server:setup` [Section titled “astro:server:setup”](#astroserversetup) **Previous hook:** [`astro:config:done`](#astroconfigdone) **Next hook:** [`astro:server:start`](#astroserverstart) **When:** Just after the Vite server is created in “dev” mode, but before the `listen()` event is fired. [See Vite’s createServer API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#createserver) for more. **Why:** To update Vite server options and middleware, or enable support for refreshing the content layer. ```js 'astro:server:setup'?: (options: { server: vite.ViteDevServer; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; toolbar: ReturnType<typeof getToolbarServerCommunicationHelpers>; refreshContent: (options: { loaders?: Array<string>; context?: Record<string, any>; }) => Promise<void>; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `server` option [Section titled “server option”](#server-option) **Type:** [`ViteDevServer`](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#vitedevserver) A mutable instance of the Vite server used in “dev” mode. For instance, this is [used by our Partytown integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/partytown/) to inject the Partytown server as middleware: ```js export default { name: 'partytown', hooks: { 'astro:server:setup': ({ server }) => { server.middlewares.use( function middleware(req, res, next) { // handle requests } ); } } } ``` #### `toolbar` option [Section titled “toolbar option”](#toolbar-option) **Type:** `ReturnType<typeof getToolbarServerCommunicationHelpers>` **Added in:** `astro@4.7.0` An object providing callback functions to interact with the [dev toolbar](/en/reference/dev-toolbar-app-reference/): ##### `toolbar.on()` [Section titled “toolbar.on()”](#toolbaron) **Type:** `<T>(event: string, callback: (data: T) => void) => void` A function that takes an event name as first argument and a callback function as second argument. This allows you to receive a message from a dev toolbar app with data associated to that event. ##### `toolbar.onAppInitialized()` [Section titled “toolbar.onAppInitialized()”](#toolbaronappinitialized) **Type:** `(appId: string, callback: (data: Record<string, never>) => void) => void` A function fired when a dev toolbar app is initialized. The first argument is the id of the app that was initialized. The second argument is a callback function to run when the app is initialized. ##### `toolbar.onAppToggled()` [Section titled “toolbar.onAppToggled()”](#toolbaronapptoggled) **Type:** `(appId: string, callback: (data: { state: boolean; }) => void) => void` A function fired when a dev toolbar app is toggled on or off. The first argument is the id of the app that was toggled. The second argument is a callback function providing the state to execute when the application is toggled. ##### `toolbar.send()` [Section titled “toolbar.send()”](#toolbarsend) **Type:** `<T>(event: string, payload: T) => void` A function that sends a message to the dev toolbar that an app can listen for. This takes an event name as the first argument and a payload as the second argument which can be any serializable data. #### `refreshContent()` option [Section titled “refreshContent() option”](#refreshcontent-option) **Type:** `(options: { loaders?: Array<string>; context?: Record<string, any>; }) => Promise<void>` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A function for integrations to trigger an update to the content layer during `astro dev`. This can be used, for example, to register a webhook endpoint during dev, or to open a socket to a CMS to listen for changes. By default, `refreshContent()` will refresh all collections. You can optionally pass a `loaders` property, which is an array of loader names. If provided, only collections that use those loaders will be refreshed. For example, A CMS integration could use this property to only refresh its own collections. You can also pass a `context` object to the loaders. This can be used to pass arbitrary data such as the webhook body, or an event from the websocket. my-integration.ts ```ts { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:server:setup': async ({ server, refreshContent }) => { // Register a dev server webhook endpoint server.middlewares.use('/_refresh', async (req, res) => { if(req.method !== 'POST') { res.statusCode = 405 res.end('Method Not Allowed'); return } let body = ''; req.on('data', chunk => { body += chunk.toString(); }); req.on('end', async () => { try { const webhookBody = JSON.parse(body); await refreshContent({ context: { webhookBody }, loaders: ['my-loader'] }); res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }); res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Content refreshed successfully' })); } catch (error) { res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }); res.end(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to refresh content: ' + error.message })); } }); }); } } } ``` The loader can then access the `refreshContextData` property to get the webhook body. See the [`refreshContextData`](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#refreshcontextdata) property for more information. ### `astro:server:start` [Section titled “astro:server:start”](#astroserverstart) **Previous hook:** [`astro:server:setup`](#astroserversetup) **Next hook:** [`astro:server:done`](#astroserverdone) **When:** Just after the server’s `listen()` event has fired. **Why:** To intercept network requests at the specified address. If you intend to use this address for middleware, consider using `astro:server:setup` instead. ```js 'astro:server:start'?: (options: { address: AddressInfo; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `address` option [Section titled “address option”](#address-option) **Type:** `AddressInfo` The address, family and port number supplied by the [`server.address()` method of the Node.js Net module](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#serveraddress). ### `astro:server:done` [Section titled “astro:server:done”](#astroserverdone) **Previous hook:** [`astro:server:start`](#astroserverstart) **When:** Just after the dev server is closed. **Why:** To run any cleanup events you may trigger during the `astro:server:setup` or `astro:server:start` hooks. ```js 'astro:server:done'?: (options: { logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` ### `astro:build:start` [Section titled “astro:build:start”](#astrobuildstart) **Previous hook:** [`astro:config:done`](#astroconfigdone) **Next hook:** [`astro:build:setup`](#astrobuildsetup) **When:** After the `astro:config:done` event, but before the production build begins. **Why:** To set up any global objects or clients needed during a production build. This can also extend the build configuration options in the [adapter API](/en/reference/adapter-reference/). ```js 'astro:build:start'?: (options: { logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` ### `astro:build:setup` [Section titled “astro:build:setup”](#astrobuildsetup) **Previous hook:** [`astro:build:start`](#astrobuildstart) **Next hook:** [`astro:build:ssr`](#astrobuildssr) **When:** After the `astro:build:start` hook, runs immediately before the build. **Why:** At this point, the Vite config for the build has been completely constructed, this is your final chance to modify it. This can be useful for example to overwrite some defaults. If you’re not sure whether you should use this hook or `astro:build:start`, use `astro:build:start` instead. ```js 'astro:build:setup'?: (options: { vite: vite.InlineConfig; pages: Map<string, PageBuildData>; target: 'client' | 'server'; updateConfig: (newConfig: vite.InlineConfig) => void; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `vite` option [Section titled “vite option”](#vite-option) **Type:** [`InlineConfig`](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#inlineconfig) An object that allows you to access the Vite configuration used in the build. This can be useful if you need to access configuration options in your integration: ```js export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:setup': ({ vite }) => { const { publicDir, root } = vite; }, } } ``` #### `pages` option [Section titled “pages option”](#pages-option) **Type:** `Map<string, PageBuildData>` A `Map` with a list of pages as key and [their build data](#the-pagebuilddata-object) as value. This can be used to perform an action if a route matches a criteria: ```js export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:setup': ({ pages }) => { pages.forEach((data) => { if (data.route.pattern.test("/blog")) { console.log(data.route.type); } }); }, } } ``` ##### The `PageBuildData` object [Section titled “The PageBuildData object”](#the-pagebuilddata-object) Describes how to build a page. ###### `PageBuildData.key` [Section titled “PageBuildData.key”](#pagebuilddatakey) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@4.8.0` Specifies a unique identifier for the page. ###### `PageBuildData.component` [Section titled “PageBuildData.component”](#pagebuilddatacomponent) **Type:** `string` Specifies the source component URL. ###### `PageBuildData.route` [Section titled “PageBuildData.route”](#pagebuilddataroute) **Type:** [`RouteData`](#routedata) Describes the information about the page route. ###### `PageBuildData.moduleSpecifier` [Section titled “PageBuildData.moduleSpecifier”](#pagebuilddatamodulespecifier) **Type:** `string` Defines a string that can be resolved into a file path for the module. ###### `PageBuildData.styles` [Section titled “PageBuildData.styles”](#pagebuilddatastyles) **Type:** `Array<{ depth: number; order: number; sheet: { type: 'inline'; content: string } | { type: 'external'; src: string } }>` **Added in:** `astro@2.4.0` A list of styles to render on the page. Each style contains its `depth` in the components tree and its display `order` on the page, as well as an indication of whether this should be applied as an inline or external style. #### `target` option [Section titled “target option”](#target-option) **Type:** `'client' | 'server'` Builds are separated in two distinct phases: `client` and `server`. This option allow you to determine the current build phase. This can be used to perform an action only in a specific phase: ```js export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:setup': ({ target }) => { if (target === "server") { // do something in server build phase } }, } } ``` #### `updateConfig()` option [Section titled “updateConfig() option”](#updateconfig-option-1) **Type:** `(newConfig: InlineConfig) => void` A callback function to update the [Vite](https://vite.dev/) options used in the build. Any config you provide **will be merged with the user config + other integration config updates**, so you are free to omit keys! For example, this can be used to supply a plugin to the user’s project: ```js import awesomeCssPlugin from 'awesome-css-vite-plugin'; export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:setup': ({ updateConfig }) => { updateConfig({ plugins: [awesomeCssPlugin()], }) } } } ``` ### `astro:build:ssr` [Section titled “astro:build:ssr”](#astrobuildssr) **Previous hook:** [`astro:build:setup`](#astrobuildsetup) **Next hook:** [`astro:build:generated`](#astrobuildgenerated) **When:** After a production SSR build has completed. **Why:** To access the SSR manifest and map of the emitted entry points. This is useful when creating custom SSR builds in plugins or integrations. * `entryPoints` maps a page route to the physical file emitted after the build; * `middlewareEntryPoint` is the file system path of the middleware file; ```js 'astro:build:ssr'?: (options: { manifest: SerializedSSRManifest; entryPoints: Map<IntegrationRouteData, URL>; middlewareEntryPoint: URL | undefined; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `manifest` option [Section titled “manifest option”](#manifest-option) **Type:** `SerializedSSRManifest` Allows you to create a custom build by accessing a serialized version of the [`SSRManifest`](#ssrmanifest). This contains the same information as `SSRManifest`, with some properties converted to serializable formats. The following example checks the [`i18n.strategy`](#ssrmanifesti18nstrategy) configuration stored in the `manifest`: ```js export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:ssr': ({ manifest }) => { const { i18n } = manifest; if (i18n?.strategy === "domains-prefix-always") { // do something } }, }, } ``` ##### `manifest.routes` [Section titled “manifest.routes”](#manifestroutes) **Type:** `SerializedRouteInfo[]` Defines a list of serialized route information. Each route contains the same properties as [`SSRManifest.routes`](#ssrmanifestroutes), with `routeData` converted to a JSON-serializable format. ##### `manifest.assets` [Section titled “manifest.assets”](#manifestassets) **Type:** `string[]` Defines a list of serialized asset file paths. ##### `manifest.componentMetadata` [Section titled “manifest.componentMetadata”](#manifestcomponentmetadata) **Type:** `[string, SSRComponentMetadata][]` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.7` Defines an array of key-value pairs where the first element is the component identifier and the second is an object describing the build metadata. ##### `manifest.inlinedScripts` [Section titled “manifest.inlinedScripts”](#manifestinlinedscripts) **Type:** `[string, string][]` Defines an array of key-value pairs where each entry is a tuple. The first element is the script identifier and the second is the script content. ##### `manifest.clientDirectives` [Section titled “manifest.clientDirectives”](#manifestclientdirectives) **Type:** `[string, string][]` **Added in:** `astro@2.5.0` Defines an array of key-value pairs where the first element is the directive name (e.g. `load`, `visible`) and the second is the directive’s implementation code. ##### `manifest.serverIslandNameMap` [Section titled “manifest.serverIslandNameMap”](#manifestserverislandnamemap) **Type:** `[string, string][]` **Added in:** `astro@4.12.0` Defines an array of key-value pairs where each entry is a tuple. The first element is the component path and the second is the assigned name. ##### `manifest.key` [Section titled “manifest.key”](#manifestkey) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@4.13.4` Specifies the cryptographic key, serialized as a string, used for encrypting server island props. #### `entryPoints` option [Section titled “entryPoints option”](#entrypoints-option) **Type:** `Map<IntegrationRouteData, URL>` **Added in:** `astro@2.7.0` A `Map` of the emitted entry points with the `IntegrationRouteData` as key and the physical file URL as value. ```js export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:ssr': ({ entryPoints }) => { entryPoints.forEach((url) => { console.log(url.href); }); }, }, } ``` #### `middlewareEntryPoint` option [Section titled “middlewareEntryPoint option”](#middlewareentrypoint-option) **Type:** `URL | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@2.8.0` Exposes the [middleware](/en/guides/middleware/) file path. ```js export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:ssr': ({ middlewareEntryPoint }) => { if (middlewareEntryPoint) { // do some operations if a middleware exist } }, }, } ``` ### `astro:build:generated` [Section titled “astro:build:generated”](#astrobuildgenerated) **Added in:** `astro@1.3.0` **Previous hook:** [`astro:build:ssr`](#astrobuildssr) **Next hook:** [`astro:build:done`](#astrobuilddone) **When:** After a static production build has finished generating routes and assets. **Why:** To access generated routes and assets **before** build artifacts are cleaned up. This is a very uncommon use case. We recommend using [`astro:build:done`](#astrobuilddone) unless you really need to access the generated files before cleanup. ```js 'astro:build:generated'?: (options: { dir: URL; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `dir` option [Section titled “dir option”](#dir-option) **Type:** [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) A URL path to the build output directory. The following example uses Node’s built-in [`fileURLToPath()`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#urlfileurltopathurl-options) utility to compute a valid absolute path string for a file provided by the integration: ```js import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'; export default { name: 'my-integration', hooks: { 'astro:build:generated': ({ dir }) => { const outFile = fileURLToPath(new URL('./my-integration.json', dir)); } } } ``` ### `astro:build:done` [Section titled “astro:build:done”](#astrobuilddone) **Previous hook:** [`astro:build:generated`](#astrobuildgenerated) **When:** After a production build (SSG or SSR) has completed. **Why:** To access generated routes and assets for extension (ex. copy content into the generated `/assets` directory). If you plan to transform generated assets, we recommend exploring the [Vite Plugin API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [configuring via `astro:config:setup`](#updateconfig-option) instead. ```js 'astro:build:done'?: (options: { pages: { pathname: string }[]; dir: URL; /** @deprecated Use the `assets` map and the new `astro:routes:resolved` hook */ routes: IntegrationRouteData[]; assets: Map<string, URL[]>; logger: AstroIntegrationLogger; }) => void | Promise<void>; ``` #### `dir` option [Section titled “dir option”](#dir-option-1) **Type:** [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) A URL path to the build output directory. The following example uses Node’s built-in [`fileURLToPath()`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#urlfileurltopathurl-options) utility to compute a valid absolute path string for a file provided by the integration before writing to it: ```js import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises'; import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'; export default function myIntegration() { return { hooks: { 'astro:build:done': async ({ dir }) => { const metadata = await getIntegrationMetadata(); // Use fileURLToPath to get a valid, cross-platform absolute path string const outFile = fileURLToPath(new URL('./my-integration.json', dir)); await writeFile(outFile, JSON.stringify(metadata)); } } } } ``` #### `routes` option [Section titled “routes option”](#routes-option-1) Caution This property is deprecated since v5.0. Check the [migration guide](/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#deprecated-routes-on-astrobuilddone-hook-integration-api). **Type:** [`IntegrationRouteData[]`](#integrationroutedata) A list of all generated routes alongside their associated metadata. You can reference the full `IntegrationRouteData` type below, but the most common properties are: * `component` - the input file path relative to the project root * `pathname` - the output file URL (undefined for routes using `[dynamic]` and `[...spread]` params) #### `assets` option [Section titled “assets option”](#assets-option) **Type:** `Map<string, URL[]>` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Contains URLs to output files paths, grouped by [`IntegrationResolvedRoute`](#integrationresolvedroute) `pattern` property. #### `pages` option [Section titled “pages option”](#pages-option-1) **Type:** `{ pathname: string }[]` A list of all generated pages. Each entry is an object with one property: * `pathname` - the finalized path of the page. ### Custom hooks [Section titled “Custom hooks”](#custom-hooks) Custom hooks can be added to integrations by extending the `IntegrationHooks` interface through [global augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#global-augmentation). ```ts declare global { namespace Astro { export interface IntegrationHook { 'your:hook': (params: YourHookParameters) => Promise<void> } } } ``` Astro reserves the `astro:` prefix for future built-in hooks. Please choose a different prefix when naming your custom hook. ## Integration types reference [Section titled “Integration types reference”](#integration-types-reference) The following types can be imported from the `astro` module: ```ts import type { AstroIntegrationLogger, AstroIntegrationMiddleware, AstroMiddlewareInstance, AstroRenderer, ClientDirectiveConfig, HookParameters, IntegrationResolvedRoute, RedirectConfig, RouteData, RoutePart, RouteType, SSRComponentMetadata, SSRLoadedRenderer, SSRLoadedRendererValue, SSRManifest, ValidRedirectStatus, // The following are deprecated: IntegrationRouteData, } from "astro"; ``` ### `AstroIntegrationLogger` [Section titled “AstroIntegrationLogger”](#astrointegrationlogger) An instance of the Astro logger, useful to write logs. This logger uses the same [log level](/en/reference/cli-reference/#--verbose) configured via CLI. **Methods available** to write to terminal: * `logger.info("Message")`; * `logger.warn("Message")`; * `logger.error("Message")`; * `logger.debug("Message")`; All the messages are prepended with a label that has the same value as the name of the integration. integration.ts ```ts import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro"; export function formatIntegration(): AstroIntegration { return { name: "astro-format", hooks: { "astro:build:done": ({ logger }) => { // do something logger.info("Integration ready."); } } } } ``` The example above will log a message that includes the provided `info` message: ```shell [astro-format] Integration ready. ``` To log some messages with a different label, use the `.fork` method to specify an alternative to the default `name`: integration.ts ```ts import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro"; export function formatIntegration(): AstroIntegration { return { name: "astro-format", hooks: { "astro:config:done": ({ logger }) => { // do something logger.info("Integration ready."); }, "astro:build:done": ({ logger }) => { const buildLogger = logger.fork("astro-format/build"); // do something buildLogger.info("Build finished.") } } } } ``` The example above will produce logs with `[astro-format]` by default, and `[astro-format/build]` when specified: ```shell [astro-format] Integration ready. [astro-format/build] Build finished. ``` ### `AstroIntegrationMiddleware` [Section titled “AstroIntegrationMiddleware”](#astrointegrationmiddleware) **Type:** `{ order: "pre" | "post"; entrypoint: string | URL; }` Describes a [middleware added by an integration](#addmiddleware-option). #### `AstroIntegrationMiddleware.order` [Section titled “AstroIntegrationMiddleware.order”](#astrointegrationmiddlewareorder) **Type:** `"pre" | "post"` Specifies whether the middleware should run before (`pre`) or after (`post`) other middleware. #### `AstroIntegrationMiddleware.entrypoint` [Section titled “AstroIntegrationMiddleware.entrypoint”](#astrointegrationmiddlewareentrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` Defines the import path of the middleware. ### `AstroMiddlewareInstance` [Section titled “AstroMiddlewareInstance”](#astromiddlewareinstance) **Type:** `{ onRequest?: MiddlewareHandler; }` An object containing an [`onRequest()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-middleware/#onrequest) property defined with the project’s middleware function when it exists. ### `AstroRenderer` [Section titled “AstroRenderer”](#astrorenderer) **Type:** `{ name: string; clientEntrypoint?: string | URL; serverEntrypoint: string | URL; }` Describes a [component framework renderer added by an integration](#addrenderer-option). #### `AstroRenderer.name` [Section titled “AstroRenderer.name”](#astrorenderername) **Type:** `string` The name of the component framework renderer. #### `AstroRenderer.clientEntrypoint` [Section titled “AstroRenderer.clientEntrypoint”](#astrorenderercliententrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` Defines the import path of the renderer that runs on the client whenever your component is used. #### `AstroRenderer.serverEntrypoint` [Section titled “AstroRenderer.serverEntrypoint”](#astrorendererserverentrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` Defines the import path of the renderer that runs during server-side requests or static builds whenever your component is used. ### `ClientDirectiveConfig` [Section titled “ClientDirectiveConfig”](#clientdirectiveconfig) **Type:** `{ name: string; entrypoint: string | URL; }` Describes a [custom client directive added by an integration](#addclientdirective-option). #### `ClientDirectiveConfig.name` [Section titled “ClientDirectiveConfig.name”](#clientdirectiveconfigname) **Type:** `string` A custom name for the event triggered by the directive. #### `ClientDirectiveConfig.entrypoint` [Section titled “ClientDirectiveConfig.entrypoint”](#clientdirectiveconfigentrypoint) **Type:** `string | URL` Defines the import path of the code executed whenever the directive is used. ### `HookParameters` [Section titled “HookParameters”](#hookparameters) You can get the type of a hook’s arguments by passing the hook’s name to the `HookParameters` utility type.

Otherwise, the value will be undefined. ## Allow installation with `astro add` [Section titled “Allow installation with astro add”](#allow-installation-with-astro-add) [The `astro add` command](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-add) allows users to easily add integrations and adapters to their project. If you want *your* integration to be installable with this tool, **add `astro-integration` to the `keywords` field in your `package.json`**: ```json { "name": "example", "keywords": ["astro-integration"], } ``` Once you [publish your integration to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish), running `astro add example` will install your package with any peer dependencies specified in your `package.json`. This will also apply your integration to the user’s `astro.config.*` like so: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; +import example from 'example'; export default defineConfig({ + integrations: [example()], }) ``` Caution This assumes your integration definition is 1) a `default` export and 2) a function. Ensure this is true before adding the `astro-integration` keyword! ## Integration Ordering [Section titled “Integration Ordering”](#integration-ordering) All integrations are run in the order that they are configured. For instance, for the array `[react(), svelte()]` in a user’s `astro.config.*`, `react` will run before `svelte`. Your integration should ideally run in any order. If this isn’t possible, we recommend documenting that your integration needs to come first or last in your user’s `integrations` configuration array. ## Combine integrations into presets [Section titled “Combine integrations into presets”](#combine-integrations-into-presets) An integration can also be written as a collection of multiple, smaller integrations. We call these collections **presets.** Instead of creating a factory function that returns a single integration object, a preset returns an *array* of integration objects. This is useful for building complex features out of multiple integrations. ```js integrations: [ // Example: where examplePreset() returns: [integrationOne, integrationTwo, ...etc] examplePreset() ] ``` ## Community Resources [Section titled “Community Resources”](#community-resources) * [Build your own Astro Integrations](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-astro-ui-framework/#chapter-8-build-your-own-astro-integrations-1) - by Emmanuel Ohans on FreeCodeCamp * [Astro Integration Template](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/astro-integration-template) - by Florian Lefebvre on GitHub

# Legacy flags

To help some users migrate between versions of Astro, we occasionally introduce `legacy` flags. These flags allow you to opt in to some deprecated or otherwise outdated behavior of Astro in the latest version, so that you can continue to upgrade and take advantage of new Astro releases until you are able to fully update your project code. ## Collections [Section titled “Collections”](#collections) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Enable legacy behavior for content collections (as used in Astro v2 through v4) astro.config.mjs ```js import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ legacy: { collections: true } }); ``` If enabled, `data` and `content` collections (only) are handled using the legacy content collections implementation. Collections with a `loader` (only) will continue to use the Content Layer API instead. Both kinds of collections may exist in the same project, each using their respective implementations. The following limitations continue to exist: * Any legacy (`type: 'content'` or `type: 'data'`) collections must continue to be located in the `src/content/` directory. * These legacy collections will not be transformed to implicitly use the `glob()` loader, and will instead be handled by legacy code. * Collections using the Content Layer API (with a `loader` defined) are forbidden in `src/content/`, but may exist anywhere else in your project. When you are ready to remove this flag and migrate to the new Content Layer API for your legacy collections, you must define a collection for any directories in `src/content/` that you want to continue to use as a collection. It is sufficient to declare an empty collection, and Astro will implicitly generate an appropriate definition for your legacy collections: src/content/config.ts ```js import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'; const blog = defineCollection({ }) export const collections = { blog }; ```

# Actions API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@4.15.0` Actions help you build a type-safe backend you can call from client code and HTML forms. All utilities to define and call actions are exposed by the `astro:actions` module. For examples and usage instructions, [see the Actions guide](/en/guides/actions/). ## Imports from `astro:actions` [Section titled “Imports from astro:actions”](#imports-from-astroactions) ```js import { ACTION_QUERY_PARAMS, ActionError, actions, defineAction, getActionContext, getActionPath, isActionError, isInputError, } from 'astro:actions'; ``` ### `defineAction()` [Section titled “defineAction()”](#defineaction) **Type:** `({ accept, input, handler }) => ActionClient` A utility to define new actions in the `src/actions/index.ts` file. This accepts a [`handler()`](#handler-property) function containing the server logic to run, and an optional [`input`](#input-validator) property to validate input parameters at runtime. src/actions/index.ts ```ts import { defineAction } from 'astro:actions'; import { z } from 'astro/zod'; export const server = { getGreeting: defineAction({ input: z.object({ name: z.string(), }), handler: async (input, context) => { return `Hello, ${input.name}!` } }) } ``` #### `handler()` property [Section titled “handler() property”](#handler-property) **Type:** `(input: TInputSchema, context: ActionAPIContext) => TOutput | Promise<TOutput>` A required function containing the server logic to run when the action is called. Data returned from the `handler()` is automatically serialized and sent to the caller. The `handler()` is called with user input as its first argument. If an [`input`](#input-validator) validator is set, the user input will be validated before being passed to the handler. The second argument is [a subset of Astro’s `context` object](#actionapicontext). Return values are parsed using the [devalue library](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue). This supports JSON values and instances of `Date()`, `Map()`, `Set()`, and `URL()`. #### `input` validator [Section titled “input validator”](#input-validator) **Type:** `ZodType | undefined` An optional property that accepts a [Zod validator](/en/reference/modules/astro-zod/#common-data-type-validators) (e.g. Zod object, Zod discriminated union) to validate handler inputs at runtime. If the action fails to validate, [a `BAD_REQUEST` error](#actionerror) is returned and the `handler` is not called. If `input` is omitted, the `handler` will receive an input of type `unknown` for JSON requests and type `FormData` for form requests. #### `accept` property [Section titled “accept property”](#accept-property) **Type:** `"form" | "json"`\ **Default:** `json` Defines the format expected by an action: * Use `form` when your action accepts `FormData`. * Use `json`, the default, for all other cases. When your action accepts form inputs, the `z.object()` validator will automatically parse `FormData` to a typed object. All Zod validators are supported to validate your inputs. Learn about [using validators with form inputs](/en/guides/actions/#using-validators-with-form-inputs) in the Actions guide, including example usage and special input handling. ### `actions` [Section titled “actions”](#actions) **Type:** `Record<string, ActionClient>` An object containing all your actions with the action name as key associated to a function to call this action. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- --- <script> import { actions } from 'astro:actions'; async () => { const { data, error } = await actions.myAction({ /* ... */ }); } </script> ``` In order for Astro to recognize this property, you may need to restart the dev server or [run the `astro sync` command](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-sync) (`s + enter`). ### `isInputError()` [Section titled “isInputError()”](#isinputerror) **Type:** `(error?: unknown) => boolean` A utility used to check whether [an `ActionError`](#actionerror) is an input validation error. When the `input` validator is a `z.object()`, input errors include a `fields` object with error messages grouped by name. See the [form input errors guide](/en/guides/actions/#displaying-form-input-errors) for more on using `isInputError()`. ### `isActionError()` [Section titled “isActionError()”](#isactionerror) **Type:** `(error?: unknown) => boolean` A utility to check whether your action raised [an `ActionError`](#actionerror) within the [handler property](#handler-property). This is useful when narrowing the type of a generic error. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- --- <script> import { isActionError, actions } from 'astro:actions'; async () => { const { data, error } = await actions.myAction({ /* ... */ }); if (isActionError(error)) { // Handle action-specific errors console.log(error.code); } } </script> ``` ### `ActionError` [Section titled “ActionError”](#actionerror) The `ActionError()` constructor is used to create errors thrown by an action `handler`. This accepts a `code` property describing the error that occurred (example: `"UNAUTHORIZED"`), and an optional `message` property with further details. The following example creates a new `ActionError` when the user is not logged in: src/actions/index.ts ```ts import { defineAction, ActionError } from "astro:actions"; export const server = { getUserOrThrow: defineAction({ accept: 'form', handler: async (_, { locals }) => { if (locals.user?.name !== 'florian') { throw new ActionError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED', message: 'Not logged in', }); } return locals.user; }, }), } ``` You can also use `ActionError` to narrow the error type when handling the results of an action: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- --- <script> import { ActionError, actions } from 'astro:actions'; async () => { const { data, error } = await actions.myAction({ /* ... */ }); if (error instanceof ActionError) { // Handle action-specific errors console.log(error.code); } } </script> ``` #### `code` [Section titled “code”](#code) **Type:** `ActionErrorCode` Defines a human-readable version of an [HTTP status code](#actionerrorcode). #### `message` [Section titled “message”](#message) **Type:** `string` An optional property to describe the error (e.g. “User must be logged in.”). #### `stack` [Section titled “stack”](#stack) **Type:** `string` An optional property to pass the stack trace. ### `getActionContext()` [Section titled “getActionContext()”](#getactioncontext) **Type:** `(context: APIContext) => AstroActionContext` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A function called from your middleware handler to retrieve information about inbound action requests. This returns an `action` object with information about the request, a `deserializeActionResult()` method, and the `setActionResult()` and `serializeActionResult()` functions to programmatically set the value returned by `Astro.getActionResult()`. `getActionContext()` lets you programmatically get and set action results using middleware, allowing you to persist action results from HTML forms, gate action requests with added security checks, and more. src/middleware.ts ```ts import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'; import { getActionContext } from 'astro:actions'; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { const { action, setActionResult, serializeActionResult } = getActionContext(context); if (action?.calledFrom === 'form') { const result = await action.handler(); setActionResult(action.name, serializeActionResult(result)); } return next(); }); ``` #### `action` [Section titled “action”](#action) **Type:** `{ calledFrom: “rpc” | “form”; name: string; handler: () => Promise<SafeResult>; } | undefined` An object containing information about an inbound action request. It is available from [`getActionContext()`](#getactioncontext), and provides the action `name`, `handler`, and whether the action was called from a client-side RPC function (e.g. `actions.newsletter()`) or an HTML form action. src/middleware.ts ```ts import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'; import { getActionContext } from 'astro:actions'; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { const { action, setActionResult, serializeActionResult } = getActionContext(context); if (action?.calledFrom === 'rpc' && action.name.startsWith('private')) { // Check for a valid session token } // ... }); ``` ##### `calledFrom` [Section titled “calledFrom”](#calledfrom) **Type:** `"rpc" | "form"` Whether an action was called using an RPC function or an HTML form action. ##### `name` [Section titled “name”](#name) **Type:** `string` The name of the action. Useful to track the source of an action result during a redirect. ##### `handler()` [Section titled “handler()”](#handler) **Type:** `() => Promise<SafeResult>` A method to programmatically call an action to get the result. #### `setActionResult()` [Section titled “setActionResult()”](#setactionresult) **Type:** `(actionName: string, actionResult: SerializedActionResult) => void` A function to programmatically set the value returned by `Astro.getActionResult()` in middleware. It is passed the action name and an action result serialized by [`serializeActionResult()`](#serializeactionresult). Calling this function from middleware will disable Astro’s own action result handling. This is useful when calling actions from an HTML form to persist and load results from a session. src/middleware.ts ```ts import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'; import { getActionContext } from 'astro:actions'; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { const { action, setActionResult, serializeActionResult } = getActionContext(context); if (action?.calledFrom === 'form') { const result = await action.handler(); // ... handle the action result setActionResult(action.name, serializeActionResult(result)); } return next(); }); ``` See the [advanced sessions guide](/en/guides/actions/#advanced-persist-action-results-with-a-session) for a sample implementation using Netlify Blob. #### `serializeActionResult()` [Section titled “serializeActionResult()”](#serializeactionresult) **Type:** `(res: SafeResult) => SerializedActionResult` Serializes an action result to JSON for persistence. This is required to properly handle non-JSON return values like `Map` or `Date` as well as the `ActionError` object. Call this function when serializing an action result to be passed to `setActionResult()`: src/middleware.ts ```ts import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'; import { getActionContext } from 'astro:actions'; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { const { action, setActionResult, serializeActionResult } = getActionContext(context); if (action) { const result = await action.handler(); setActionResult(action.name, serializeActionResult(result)); } // ... }); ``` #### `deserializeActionResult()` [Section titled “deserializeActionResult()”](#deserializeactionresult) **Type:** `(res: SerializedActionResult) => SafeResult` Reverses the effect of [`serializeActionResult()`](#serializeactionresult) and returns an action result to its original state. This is useful to access the `data` and `error` objects on a serialized action result. ### `getActionPath()` [Section titled “getActionPath()”](#getactionpath) **Type:** `(action: ActionClient) => string` **Added in:** `astro@5.1.0` A utility that accepts an action and returns a URL path so you can execute an action call as a `fetch()` operation directly. This allows you to provide details such as custom headers when you call your action. Then, you can [handle the custom-formatted returned data](/en/guides/actions/#handling-returned-data) as needed, just as if you had called an action directly. This example shows how to call a defined `like` action passing the `Authorization` header and the [`keepalive`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/keepalive) option: src/components/my-component.astro ```astro <script> import { actions, getActionPath } from 'astro:actions' await fetch(getActionPath(actions.like), { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' }, body: JSON.stringify({ id: 'YOUR_ID' }), keepalive: true }) </script> ``` This example shows how to call the same `like` action using the [`sendBeacon`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon) API: src/components/my-component.astro ```astro <script> import { actions, getActionPath } from 'astro:actions' navigator.sendBeacon( getActionPath(actions.like), new Blob([JSON.stringify({ id: 'YOUR_ID' })], { type: 'application/json' }) ) </script> ``` ### `ACTION_QUERY_PARAMS` [Section titled “ACTION\_QUERY\_PARAMS”](#action_query_params) **Type:** `{ actionName: string, actionPayload: string }` An object containing the query parameter names used internally by Astro when handling form action submissions. When you submit a form using an action, the following query parameters are added to the URL to track the action call: * `actionName` - The query parameter that contains the name of the action being called * `actionPayload` - The query parameter that contains the serialized form data This constant can be useful when you need to clean up URLs after a form submission. For example, you might want to remove action-related query parameters during a redirect: src/pages/api/contact.ts ```ts import type { APIRoute } from "astro"; import { ACTION_QUERY_PARAMS } from 'astro:actions' export const GET: APIRoute = ({ params, request }) => { const link = request.url.searchParams; link.delete(ACTION_QUERY_PARAMS.actionName); link.delete(ACTION_QUERY_PARAMS.actionPayload); return redirect(link, 303); }; ``` ## `astro:actions` types [Section titled “astro:actions types”](#astroactions-types) ```ts import type { ActionAPIContext, ActionClient, ActionErrorCode, ActionInputSchema, ActionReturnType, SafeResult, } from 'astro:actions'; ``` ### `ActionAPIContext` [Section titled “ActionAPIContext”](#actionapicontext) A subset of the [Astro context object](/en/reference/api-reference/). The following properties are not available: `callAction`, `getActionResult`, `props`, and `redirect`. ### `ActionClient` [Section titled “ActionClient”](#actionclient) **Types:** * `(input?: any) => Promise<SafeResult>` * `{ queryString?: string; orThrow: (input?: any) => Promise<Awaited<TOutput>>; }` Represents an action to be called on the client. You can use it as a function that accepts input data and returns a Promise with a [`SafeResult` object](#saferesult) containing the action result or validation errors. The following example shows how you can provide error handling with an `if` statement when incrementing the like count fails: src/pages/posts/post-1.astro ```astro --- --- <!-- your template --> <script> import { actions } from 'astro:actions'; const post = document.querySelector('article'); const button = document.querySelector('button'); button?.addEventListener('click', async () => { const { data: updatedLikes, error } = await actions.likePost({ postId: post?.id }); if (error) { /* handle errors */ } }) </script> ``` Alternatively, you can use it as an object giving you access to the `queryString` and an alternative `orThrow()` method. #### `queryString` property [Section titled “queryString property”](#querystring-property) **Type:** `string` A string representation of the action that can be used to construct form action URLs. This can be useful when your form component is used in multiple places but you need to redirect to a different URL on submit. The following example uses `queryString` to construct a URL that will be passed to the form `action` attribute through a custom prop: src/pages/postal-service.astro ```astro --- import { actions } from 'astro:actions'; import FeedbackForm from "../components/FeedbackForm.astro"; const feedbackUrl = new URL('/feedback', Astro.url); feedbackUrl.search = actions.myAction.queryString; --- <FeedbackForm sendTo={feedbackUrl.pathname} /> ``` #### `orThrow()` property [Section titled “orThrow() property”](#orthrow-property) **Type:** `(input?: any) => Promise<Awaited<TOutput>>` A method that throws an error on failure instead of returning the errors. This is useful when you want exceptions rather than error handling. The following example uses `orThrow()` to skip error handling when incrementing the like count fails: src/pages/posts/post-1.astro ```astro --- --- <!-- your template --> <script> import { actions } from 'astro:actions'; const post = document.querySelector('article'); const button = document.querySelector('button'); button?.addEventListener('click', async () => { const updatedLikes = await actions.likePost.orThrow({ postId: post?.id }); }) </script> ``` ### `ActionErrorCode` [Section titled “ActionErrorCode”](#actionerrorcode) **Type:** `string` A union type of standard HTTP status codes [defined by IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) using the human-readable versions as uppercase strings separated by an underscore (e.g. `BAD_REQUEST` or `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`). ### `ActionInputSchema` [Section titled “ActionInputSchema”](#actioninputschema) **Type:** `ZodType` **Added in:** `astro@5.16.0` A utility type that automatically infers the TypeScript type of an action’s input based on its Zod schema. This can be useful to reference an action’s [`input` validator type](#input-validator) as an object in your own type definitions. Returns `never` when [`input` validator](#input-validator) is omitted. The following example uses `ActionInputSchema` on an action named `contact` to: * Retrieve the Zod schema type for the input of the action. * Retrieve the expected input type of the action’s validator. src/components/Form.astro ```astro --- import { actions, ActionInputSchema } from 'astro:actions'; import { z } from 'astro/zod'; type ContactSchema = ActionInputSchema<typeof actions.contact>; type ContactInput = z.input<ContactSchema>; --- ``` ### `ActionReturnType` [Section titled “ActionReturnType”](#actionreturntype) **Type:** `Awaited<ReturnType<ActionHandler>>` A utility type that extracts the output type from [an action handler](#defineaction). This unwraps both the `Promise` (if the handler is async) and the `ReturnType` to give you the [actual output type](#saferesult). This can be useful if you need to reference an action’s output type in your own type definitions. The following example uses `ActionReturnType` to retrieve the expected output type for an action named `contact`: src/components/Form.astro ```astro --- import { actions, ActionReturnType } from 'astro:actions'; type ContactResult = ActionReturnType<typeof actions.contact>; --- ``` ### `SafeResult` [Section titled “SafeResult”](#saferesult) **Type:** `{ data: TOutput, error: undefined } | { data: undefined, error: ActionError }` Represents the result of an action call: * on success, `data` contains the output of the action and `error` is `undefined`. * on failure, `error` contains an [`ActionError`](#actionerror) with validation errors or runtime errors, and `data` is `undefined`.

# Image and Assets API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@3.0.0` Astro provides built-in components and helper functions for optimizing and displaying your images. For features and usage examples, [see our image guide](/en/guides/images/). ## Imports from `astro:assets` [Section titled “Imports from astro:assets”](#imports-from-astroassets) The following helpers are imported from the virtual assets module: ```js import { Image, Picture, getImage, inferRemoteSize, getConfiguredImageService, imageConfig, } from 'astro:assets'; ``` ### `<Image />` [Section titled “\<Image />”](#image-) The `<Image />` component optimizes and transforms images. This component can also be used to create [responsive images](#responsive-image-properties) that can adjust based on the size of their container or a device screen size and resolution. src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- // import the Image component and the image import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900 --- <!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component --> <Image src={myImage} alt="A description of my image." /> ``` ```html <!-- Output --> <!-- Image is optimized, proper attributes are enforced --> <img src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp" width="1600" height="900" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A description of my image." /> ``` The `<Image />` component accepts the following listed properties and [responsive image properties](#responsive-image-properties) in addition to all properties accepted by the HTML `<img>` tag. #### `src` (required) [Section titled “src (required)”](#src-required) **Type:** `ImageMetadata | string | Promise<{ default: ImageMetadata }>` The format of the `src` value of your image file depends on where your image file is located: * **Local images in `src/`** - you must **also import the image** using a relative file path or configure and use an [import alias](/en/guides/imports/#aliases). Then use the import name as the `src` value: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImportedImage from '../assets/my-local-image.png'; --- <Image src={myImportedImage} alt="descriptive text" /> ``` * **Images in the `public/` folder** - use the image’s **file path relative to the public folder**: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; --- <Image src="/images/my-public-image.png" alt="descriptive text" width="200" height="150" /> ``` * **Remote images** - use the image’s **full URL** as the property value: src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; --- <Image src="https://example.com/remote-image.jpg" alt="descriptive text" width="200" height="150" /> ``` #### `alt` (required) [Section titled “alt (required)”](#alt-required) **Type:** `string` Use the required `alt` attribute to provide a string of [descriptive alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for images. If an image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn’t contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers and other assistive technologies know to ignore the image. #### `width` and `height` (required for images in `public/`) [Section titled “width and height (required for images in public/)”](#width-and-height-required-for-images-in-public) **Type:** ``number | `${number}` | undefined`` These properties define the dimensions to use for the image. When a `layout` type is set, these are automatically generated based on the image’s dimensions and in most cases should not be set manually. When using images in their original aspect ratio, `width` and `height` are optional. These dimensions can be automatically inferred from image files located in `src/`. For remote images, add [the `inferSize` attribute set to `true`](#infersize) on the `<Image />` or `<Picture />` component or use [`inferRemoteSize()` function](#inferremotesize). However, both of these properties are required for images stored in your `public/` folder as Astro is unable to analyze these files. #### `densities` [Section titled “densities”](#densities) **Type:** ``(number | `${number}x`)[] | undefined`` **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` A list of pixel densities to generate for the image. The `densities` attribute is not compatible with [responsive images](#responsive-image-properties) with a `layout` prop or `image.layout` config set, and will be ignored if set. If provided, this value will be used to generate a `srcset` attribute on the `<img>` tag. Do not provide a value for `widths` when using this value. Densities that are equal to widths larger than the original image will be ignored to avoid upscaling the image. src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; --- <Image src={myImage} width={myImage.width / 2} densities={[1.5, 2]} alt="A description of my image." /> ``` ```html <!-- Output --> <img src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp" srcset=" /_astro/my_image.hash.webp 1.5x /_astro/my_image.hash.webp 2x " alt="A description of my image." width="800" height="450" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ``` #### `widths` [Section titled “widths”](#widths) **Type:** `number[] | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` A list of widths to generate for the image. If provided, this value will be used to generate a `srcset` attribute on the `<img>` tag. A [`sizes` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes) must also be provided. The `widths` and `sizes` attributes will be automatically generated for responsive images using a `layout` property. Providing these values is generally not needed, but can be used to override any automatically generated values. Do not provide a value for `densities` when using this value. Only one of these two values can be used to generate a `srcset`. Widths that are larger than the original image will be ignored to avoid upscaling the image. src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; // Image is 1600x900 --- <Image src={myImage} widths={[240, 540, 720, myImage.width]} sizes={`(max-width: 360px) 240px, (max-width: 720px) 540px, (max-width: 1600px) 720px, ${myImage.width}px`} alt="A description of my image." /> ``` ```html <!-- Output --> <img src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp" srcset=" /_astro/my_image.hash.webp 240w, /_astro/my_image.hash.webp 540w, /_astro/my_image.hash.webp 720w, /_astro/my_image.hash.webp 1600w " sizes=" (max-width: 360px) 240px, (max-width: 720px) 540px, (max-width: 1600px) 720px, 1600px " alt="A description of my image." width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ``` #### `sizes` [Section titled “sizes”](#sizes) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` Specifies the layout width of the image for each of a list of media conditions. Must be provided when specifying `widths`. The `widths` and `sizes` attributes will be automatically generated for responsive images using a `layout` property. Providing these values is generally not needed, but can be used to override any automatically generated values. The generated `sizes` attribute for `constrained` and `full-width` images is based on the assumption that the image is displayed close to the full width of the screen when the viewport is smaller than the image’s width. If it is significantly different (e.g. if it’s in a multi-column layout on small screens), you may need to adjust the `sizes` attribute manually for best results. #### `format` [Section titled “format”](#format) **Type:** `ImageOutputFormat | undefined` You can optionally state the [image file type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#common_image_file_types) output to be used. By default, the `<Image />` component will produce a `.webp` file. #### `quality` [Section titled “quality”](#quality) **Type:** `ImageQuality | undefined` `quality` is an optional property that can either be: * a preset (`low`, `mid`, `high`, `max`) that is automatically normalized between formats. * a number from `0` to `100` (interpreted differently between formats). #### `inferSize` [Section titled “inferSize”](#infersize) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@4.4.0` Allows you to set the original `width` and `height` of a remote image automatically. By default, this value is set to `false` and you must manually specify both dimensions for your remote image. Add `inferSize` to the `<Image />` component (or `inferSize: true` to `getImage()`) to infer these values from the image content when fetched. This is helpful if you don’t know the dimensions of the remote image, or if they might change: src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; --- <Image src="https://example.com/cat.png" inferSize alt="A cat sleeping in the sun." /> ``` `inferSize` can fetch the dimensions of a [remote image from a domain that has not been authorized](/en/guides/images/#authorizing-remote-images), however the image itself will remain unprocessed. #### `priority` [Section titled “priority”](#priority) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` Allows you to automatically set the `loading`, `decoding`, and `fetchpriority` attributes to their optimal values for above-the-fold images. src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; --- <Image src={myImage} priority alt="A description of my image" /> ``` When `priority="true"` (or the shorthand syntax `priority`) is added to the `<Image />` or `<Picture />` component, it will add the following attributes to instruct the browser to load the image immediately: ```html loading="eager" decoding="sync" fetchpriority="high" ``` These individual attributes can still be set manually if you need to customize them further. #### `background` [Section titled “background”](#background) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@5.17.0` New The background color to use when flattening an image to transform it into the requested output `format`. By default, Sharp uses a black background when flattening an image. Specifying a different background color is especially useful when transforming images with transparent backgrounds to a format that does not support transparency (e.g. `.jpeg`): src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; --- <Image src={myImage} alt="A description of my image" format="jpeg" background="#ffffff" /> ``` Values are passed directly to the image service. Sharp accepts [any value the `color-string` package can parse](https://github.com/Qix-/color-string/blob/master/README.md#parsing). ### `<Picture />` [Section titled “\<Picture />”](#picture-) **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` The `<Picture />` component generates an optimized image with multiple formats and/or sizes. This component can also be used to create [responsive images](#responsive-image-properties) that can adjust based on the size of their container or a device screen size and resolution. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { Picture } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900 --- <!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Picture component --> <Picture src={myImage} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="A description of my image." /> ``` ```html <!-- Output --> <picture> <source srcset="/_astro/my_image.hash.avif" type="image/avif" /> <source srcset="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp" type="image/webp" /> <img src="/_astro/my_image.hash.png" width="1600" height="900" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A description of my image." /> </picture> ``` `<Picture />` accepts all the properties of [the `<Image />` component](#image-), including [responsive image properties](#responsive-image-properties), plus the following: #### `formats` [Section titled “formats”](#formats) **Type:** `ImageOutputFormat[]` An array of image formats to use for the `<source>` tags. Entries will be added as `<source>` elements in the order they are listed, and this order determines which format is displayed. For the best performance, list the most modern format first (e.g. `webp` or `avif`). By default, this is set to `['webp']`. #### `fallbackFormat` [Section titled “fallbackFormat”](#fallbackformat) **Type:** [`ImageOutputFormat`](#imageoutputformat) Format to use as a fallback value for the `<img>` tag. Defaults to `.png` for static images (or `.jpg` if the image is a JPG), `.gif` for animated images, and `.svg` for SVG files. #### `pictureAttributes` [Section titled “pictureAttributes”](#pictureattributes) **Type:** `HTMLAttributes<'picture'>` An object of attributes to be added to the `<picture>` tag. Use this property to apply attributes to the outer `<picture>` element itself. Attributes applied to the `<Picture />` component directly will apply to the inner `<img>` element, except for those used for image transformation. src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Picture } from "astro:assets"; import myImage from "../my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900 --- <Picture src={myImage} alt="A description of my image." pictureAttributes={{ style: "background-color: red;" }} /> ``` ```html <!-- Output --> <picture style="background-color: red;"> <source srcset="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp" type="image/webp" /> <img src="/_astro/my_image.hash.png" alt="A description of my image." width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> </picture> ``` ### Responsive image properties [Section titled “Responsive image properties”](#responsive-image-properties) Setting the [`layout`](#layout) property on an [`<Image />`](#image-) or [`<Picture />`](#picture-) component creates a responsive image and enables additional property settings. src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; --- <Image src={myImage} alt="A description of my image." layout='constrained' width={800} height={600} /> ``` When a layout is set, `srcset` and `sizes` attributes are automatically generated based on the image’s dimensions and the layout type. The previous `<Image />` component will generate the following HTML output: ```html <img src="/_astro/my_image.hash3.webp" srcset="/_astro/my_image.hash1.webp 640w, /_astro/my_image.hash2.webp 750w, /_astro/my_image.hash3.webp 800w, /_astro/my_image.hash4.webp 828w, /_astro/my_image.hash5.webp 1080w, /_astro/my_image.hash6.webp 1280w, /_astro/my_image.hash7.webp 1600w" alt="A description of my image" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="800" height="600" style="--fit: cover; --pos: center;" data-astro-image="constrained" > ``` The value for `layout` also defines the default styles applied to the `<img>` tag to determine how the image should resize according to its container: Responsive Image Styles ```css :where([data-astro-image]) { object-fit: var(--fit); object-position: var(--pos); } :where([data-astro-image='full-width']) { width: 100%; } :where([data-astro-image='constrained']) { max-width: 100%; } ``` You can override the default `object-fit` and `object-position` styles by setting the [`fit`](#fit) and [`position`](#position) props on the `<Image />` or `<Picture />` component. ##### `layout` [Section titled “layout”](#layout) **Type:** `'constrained' | 'full-width' | 'fixed' | 'none'`\ **Default:** `image.layout | 'none'` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` Defines a [responsive image](#responsive-image-properties) and determines how the image should resize when its container changes size. Can be used to override the default configured value for [`image.layout`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imagelayout). * `constrained` - The image will scale down to fit the container, maintaining its aspect ratio, but will not scale up beyond the specified `width` and `height`, or the image’s original dimensions. Use this if you want the image to display at the requested size where possible, but shrink to fit smaller screens. This matches the default behavior for images when using Tailwind. If you’re not sure, this is probably the layout you should choose. * `full-width` - The image will scale to fit the width of the container, maintaining its aspect ratio. Use this for hero images or other images that should take up the full width of the page. * `fixed` - The image will maintain the requested dimensions and not resize. It will generate a `srcset` to support high density displays, but not for different screen sizes. Use this if the image will not resize, for example icons or logos smaller than any screen width, or other images in a fixed-width container. * `none` - The image will not be responsive. No `srcset` or `sizes` will be automatically generated, and no styles will be applied. This is useful if you have enabled a default layout, but want to disable it for a specific image. For example, with `constrained` set as the default layout, you can override any individual image’s `layout` property: src/components/MyComponent.astro ```astro --- import { Image } from 'astro:assets'; import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; --- <Image src={myImage} alt="This will use constrained layout" width={800} height={600} /> <Image src={myImage} alt="This will use full-width layout" layout="full-width" /> <Image src={myImage} alt="This will disable responsive images" layout="none" /> ``` ##### `fit` [Section titled “fit”](#fit) **Type:** `'contain' | 'cover' | 'fill' | 'none' | 'scale-down'`\ **Default:** `image.objectFit | 'cover'` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` Enabled when the [`layout`](#layout) property is set or configured. Defines how a responsive image should be cropped if its aspect ratio is changed. Values match those of CSS `object-fit`. Defaults to `cover`, or the value of [`image.objectFit`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imageobjectfit) if set. Can be used to override the default `object-fit` styles. ##### `position` [Section titled “position”](#position) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `image.objectPosition | 'center'` **Added in:** `astro@5.10.0` Enabled when the [`layout`](#layout) property is set or configured. Defines the position of the image crop for a responsive image if the aspect ratio is changed. Values match those of CSS `object-position`. Defaults to `center`, or the value of [`image.objectPosition`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imageobjectposition) if set. Can be used to override the default `object-position` styles. ### `getImage()` [Section titled “getImage()”](#getimage) **Type:** `(options: UnresolvedImageTransform) => Promise<GetImageResult>` Caution `getImage()` relies on server-only APIs and breaks the build when used on the client. The `getImage()` function is intended for generating images destined to be used somewhere else than directly in HTML, for example in an [API Route](/en/guides/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes). It also allows you to create your own custom `<Image />` component. This takes an options object with the [same properties as the Image component](#image-) (except `alt`) and returns a [`GetImageResult` object](#getimageresult). The following example generates an AVIF `background-image` for a `<div />`: src/components/Background.astro ```astro --- import { getImage } from "astro:assets"; import myBackground from "../background.png" const optimizedBackground = await getImage({src: myBackground, format: 'avif'}) --- <div style={`background-image: url(${optimizedBackground.src});`}><slot /></div> ``` ### `inferRemoteSize()` [Section titled “inferRemoteSize()”](#inferremotesize) **Type:** `(url: string) => Promise<Omit<ImageMetadata, ‘src’ | ‘fsPath’>>` **Added in:** `astro@4.12.0` A function to set the original `width` and `height` of a remote image automatically. This can be used as an alternative to passing the [`inferSize` ](#infersize)property. ```ts import { inferRemoteSize } from 'astro:assets'; const { width, height } = await inferRemoteSize("https://example.com/cat.png"); ``` ### `getConfiguredImageService()` [Section titled “getConfiguredImageService()”](#getconfiguredimageservice) **Type:** `() => Promise<ImageService>` **Added in:** `astro@2.1.3` Retrieves the resolved [image service](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imageservice). ### `imageConfig` [Section titled “imageConfig”](#imageconfig) **Type:** [`AstroConfig["image"]`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#image-options) **Added in:** `astro@3.0.9` The [configuration options for images](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#image-options) set by the user and merged with all defaults. ## `astro:assets` types [Section titled “astro:assets types”](#astroassets-types) The following types are imported from the virtual assets module: ```ts import type { LocalImageProps, RemoteImageProps, } from "astro/assets"; ``` ### `LocalImageProps` [Section titled “LocalImageProps”](#localimageprops) **Type:** `ImageSharedProps<T> & { src: ImageMetadata | Promise<{ default: ImageMetadata; }> }` Describes the [properties of a local image](#image-). This ensures that [`src`](#src-required) matches the shape of an imported image. Learn more about [imported images in `src/`](/en/guides/images/#images-in-src) with an example usage. ### `RemoteImageProps` [Section titled “RemoteImageProps”](#remoteimageprops) **Types:** * `ImageSharedProps<T> & { src: string; inferSize: true; }` * `ImageSharedProps<T> & { src: string; inferSize?: false | undefined; }` Describes the [properties of a remote image](#image-). This ensures that when [`inferSize`](#infersize) is not provided or is set to `false`, both [`width` and `height`](#width-and-height-required-for-images-in-public) are required. ## Imports from `astro/assets` [Section titled “Imports from astro/assets”](#imports-from-astroassets-1) The following helpers are imported from the regular assets module: ```ts import { baseService, getConfiguredImageService, getImage, isLocalService, } from "astro/assets"; ``` ### `baseService` [Section titled “baseService”](#baseservice) **Type:** `Omit<LocalImageService, ‘transform’>` The built-in local image service which can be extended to [create a custom image service](/en/reference/image-service-reference/). The following example reuses the `baseService` to create a new image service: src/image-service.ts ```ts import { baseService } from "astro/assets"; const newImageService = { getURL: baseService.getURL, parseURL: baseService.parseURL, getHTMLAttributes: baseService.getHTMLAttributes, async transform(inputBuffer, transformOptions) {...} } ``` ### `getConfiguredImageService()` [Section titled “getConfiguredImageService()”](#getconfiguredimageservice-1) See [`getConfiguredImageService()`](#getconfiguredimageservice) from `astro:assets`. ### `getImage()` [Section titled “getImage()”](#getimage-1) **Type:** `(options: UnresolvedImageTransform, imageConfig: AstroConfig[‘image’]) => Promise<GetImageResult>` A function similar to [`getImage()`](#getimage) from `astro:assets` with two required arguments: an `options` object with [the same properties as the Image component](#image-) and a second object for the [image configuration](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#image-options). ### `isLocalService()` [Section titled “isLocalService()”](#islocalservice) **Type:** `(service: ImageService | undefined) => boolean` Checks the type of an image service and returns `true` when this is a [local service](#localimageservice). ## `astro/assets` types [Section titled “astro/assets types”](#astroassets-types-1) The following types are imported from the regular assets module: ```ts import type { LocalImageProps, RemoteImageProps, } from "astro/assets"; ``` ### `LocalImageProps` [Section titled “LocalImageProps”](#localimageprops-1) See [`LocalImageProps`](#localimageprops) from `astro:assets`. ### `RemoteImageProps` [Section titled “RemoteImageProps”](#remoteimageprops-1) See [`RemoteImageProps`](#remoteimageprops) from `astro:assets`. ## Imports from `astro/assets/utils` [Section titled “Imports from astro/assets/utils”](#imports-from-astroassetsutils) The following helpers are imported from the `utils` directory in the regular assets module and can be used to [build an image service](/en/reference/image-service-reference/): ```ts import { isRemoteAllowed, matchHostname, matchPathname, matchPattern, matchPort, matchProtocol, isESMImportedImage, isRemoteImage, resolveSrc, imageMetadata, emitImageMetadata, getOrigQueryParams, inferRemoteSize, propsToFilename, hashTransform, /* The following are deprecated: */ emitESMImage, } from "astro/assets/utils"; ``` ### `isRemoteAllowed()` [Section titled “isRemoteAllowed()”](#isremoteallowed) **Type:** `(src: string, { domains, remotePatterns }: { domains: string[], remotePatterns: RemotePattern[] }) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Determines whether a given remote resource, identified by its source URL, is allowed based on specified domains and remote patterns. ```ts import { isRemoteAllowed } from 'astro/assets/utils';

// Output: `true` ``` ### `matchPattern()` [Section titled “matchPattern()”](#matchpattern) **Type:** `(url: URL, remotePattern: RemotePattern) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Evaluates whether a given URL matches the specified remote pattern based on protocol, hostname, port, and pathname. ```ts import { matchPattern } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const url = new URL('https://images.example.com/photos/test.jpg'); const remotePattern = { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'images.example.com', pathname: '/photos/**', // Allow all files under /photos/ }; matchPattern(url, remotePattern); // Output: `true` ``` ### `matchPort()` [Section titled “matchPort()”](#matchport) **Type:** `(url: URL, port?: string) => boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Checks if the given URL’s port matches the specified port. If no port is provided, it returns `true`. ```ts import { matchPort } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const urlWithPort = new URL('https://example.com:8080/resource'); const urlWithoutPort = new URL('https://example.com/resource'); matchPort(urlWithPort, '8080'); // Output: `true` matchPort(urlWithoutPort, '8080'); // Output: `false` ``` ### `matchProtocol()` [Section titled “matchProtocol()”](#matchprotocol) **Type:** `(url: URL, protocol?: string) => boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Compares the protocol of the provided URL with a specified protocol. This returns `true` if the protocol matches or if no protocol is provided. ```ts import { matchProtocol } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const secureUrl = new URL('https://example.com/resource'); const regularUrl = new URL('http://example.com/resource'); matchProtocol(secureUrl, 'https'); // Output: `true` matchProtocol(regularUrl, 'https'); // Output: `false` ``` ### `isESMImportedImage()` [Section titled “isESMImportedImage()”](#isesmimportedimage) **Type:** `(src: ImageMetadata | string) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Determines if the given source is an ECMAScript Module (ESM) imported image. ```ts import { isESMImportedImage } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const imageMetadata = { src: '/images/photo.jpg', width: 800, height: 600, format: 'jpg', }; const filePath = '/images/photo.jpg'; isESMImportedImage(imageMetadata); // Output: `true` isESMImportedImage(filePath); // Output: `false` ``` ### `isRemoteImage()` [Section titled “isRemoteImage()”](#isremoteimage) **Type:** `(src: ImageMetadata | string) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Determines if the provided source is a remote image URL in the form of a string. ```ts import { isRemoteImage } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const imageUrl = 'https://example.com/images/photo.jpg'; const localImage = { src: '/images/photo.jpg', width: 800, height: 600, format: 'jpg', }; isRemoteImage(imageUrl); // Output: `true` isRemoteImage(localImage); // Output: `false` ``` ### `resolveSrc()` [Section titled “resolveSrc()”](#resolvesrc) **Type:** `(src: UnresolvedImageTransform[‘src’]) => Promise<string | ImageMetadata>` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Returns the image source. This function ensures that if `src` is a Promise (e.g., a dynamic `import()`), it is awaited and the correct `src` is extracted. If `src` is already a resolved value, it is returned as-is. ```ts import { resolveSrc } from 'astro/assets/utils'; import localImage from "./images/photo.jpg"; const resolvedLocal = await resolveSrc(localImage); // Example value: `{ src: '/@fs/home/username/dev/astro-project/src/images/photo.jpg', width: 800, height: 600, format: 'jpg' }` const resolvedRemote = await resolveSrc("https://example.com/remote-img.jpg"); // Value: `"https://example.com/remote-img.jpg"` const resolvedDynamic = await resolveSrc(import("./images/dynamic-image.jpg")) // Example value: `{ src: '/@fs/home/username/dev/astro-project/src/images/dynamic-image.jpg', width: 800, height: 600, format: 'jpg' }` ``` ### `imageMetadata()` [Section titled “imageMetadata()”](#imagemetadata) **Type:** `(data: Uint8Array, src?: string) => Promise<Omit<ImageMetadata, ‘src’ | ‘fsPath’>>` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Extracts image metadata such as dimensions, format, and orientation from the provided image data. ```ts import { imageMetadata } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const binaryImage = new Uint8Array([/* ...binary image data... */]); const sourcePath = '/images/photo.jpg'; const metadata = await imageMetadata(binaryImage, sourcePath); // Example value: // { // width: 800, // height: 600, // format: 'jpg', // orientation: undefined // } ``` ### `emitImageMetadata()` [Section titled “emitImageMetadata()”](#emitimagemetadata) **Type:** `(id: string | undefined, fileEmitter?: Rollup.EmitFile) => Promise<(ImageMetadata & { contents?: Buffer }) | undefined>` **Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` Processes an image file and emits its metadata and optionally its contents.

The formatted filename follows this structure: `<prefixDirname>/<baseFilename>_<hash><outputExtension>` * `prefixDirname`: If the image is an ESM imported image, this is the directory name of the original file path; otherwise, it will be an empty string. * `baseFilename`: The base name of the file or a hashed short name if the file is a `data:` URI. * `hash`: A unique hash string generated to distinguish the transformed file. * `outputExtension`: The desired output file extension derived from the `transform.format` or the original file extension. ```ts import { propsToFilename } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const filePath = '/images/photo.jpg'; const transform = { format: 'png', src: filePath }; const hash = 'abcd1234'; const filename = propsToFilename(filePath, transform, hash); // Example value: '/images/photo_abcd1234.png' ``` ### `hashTransform()` [Section titled “hashTransform()”](#hashtransform) **Type:** `(transform: ImageTransform, imageService: string, propertiesToHash: string[]) => string` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Transforms the provided `transform` object into a hash string based on selected properties and the specified `imageService`. ```ts import { hashTransform } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const transform = { src: '/images/photo.jpg', width: 800, height: 600, format: 'jpg', }; const imageService = 'astro/assets/services/sharp'; const propertiesToHash = ['width', 'height', 'format']; const hash = hashTransform(transform, imageService, propertiesToHash); // Example value: 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e' ``` ### `emitESMImage()` [Section titled “emitESMImage()”](#emitesmimage) Deprecated Use the [`emitImageMetadata`](#emitimagemetadata) function instead. **Type:** `(id: string | undefined, _watchMode: boolean, experimentalSvgEnabled: boolean, fileEmitter?: Rollup.EmitFile) => Promise<(ImageMetadata & { contents?: Buffer }) | undefined>` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Processes an image file and emits its metadata and optionally its contents. In build mode, the function uses `fileEmitter` to generate an asset reference. In development mode, it resolves to a local file URL with query parameters for metadata. ```ts import { emitESMImage } from 'astro/assets/utils'; const imageId = '/images/photo.jpg'; const unusedWatchMode = false; // Deprecated, unused const unusedExperimentalSvgEnabled = false; // Set to `true` only if you are using SVG and want the file data to be embedded const image = await emitESMImage(imageId, unusedWatchMode, unusedExperimentalSvgEnabled); // Example value: // { // src: '/@fs/home/username/dev/astro-project/src/images/photo.jpg?origWidth=800&origHeight=600&origFormat=jpg', // width: 800, // height: 600, // format: 'jpg', // contents: Uint8Array([...]) // } ``` ## `astro` types [Section titled “astro types”](#astro-types) ```ts import type { GetImageResult, ImageTransform, UnresolvedImageTransform, ImageMetadata, ImageInputFormat, ImageOutputFormat, ImageQuality, ImageQualityPreset, RemotePattern, ImageService, ExternalImageService, LocalImageService, ImageServiceConfig, } from "astro"; ``` ### `GetImageResult` [Section titled “GetImageResult”](#getimageresult) **Type:** `object` **Added in:** `astro@2.2.0` Describes the result of the transformation after the call to [`getImage()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#getimage). #### `attributes` [Section titled “attributes”](#attributes) **Type:** `Record<string, any>` Defines the additional HTML attributes needed to render the image (e.g. width, height, style). #### `options` [Section titled “options”](#options) **Type:** [`ImageTransform`](#imagetransform) Describes the transformation settings after validation. #### `rawOptions` [Section titled “rawOptions”](#rawoptions) **Type:** [`ImageTransform`](#imagetransform) Describes the original transformation settings. #### `src` [Section titled “src”](#src) **Type:** `string` The path to the generated image. #### `srcSet` [Section titled “srcSet”](#srcset) **Type:** `{ values: { transform: ImageTransform; descriptor?: string; attributes?: Record<string, any>; url: string; }[]; attribute: string; }` **Added in:** `astro@3.3.0` An object describing how to render the [`srcset` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#srcset). ##### `values` [Section titled “values”](#values) **Type:** `{ transform: ImageTransform; descriptor?: string; attributes?: Record<string, any>; url: string; }[]` An array of generated values where each entry includes a URL and a size descriptor.

# Config imports API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@5.7.0` This virtual module `astro:config` exposes a non-exhaustive, serializable, type-safe version of the Astro configuration. There are two submodules for accessing different subsets of your configuration values: [`/client`](#imports-from-astroconfigclient) and [`/server`](#imports-from-astroconfigserver). All available config values can be accessed from `astro:config/server`. However, for code executed on the client, only those values exposed by `astro:config/client` will be available. This protects your information by only making some data available to the client. ## Imports from `astro:config/client` [Section titled “Imports from astro:config/client”](#imports-from-astroconfigclient) ```js import { i18n, trailingSlash, base, build, site, compressHTML, } from "astro:config/client"; ``` Use this submodule for client-side code: src/utils.js ```diff +import { trailingSlash } from "astro:config/client"; function addForwardSlash(path) { if (trailingSlash === "always") { return path.endsWith("/") ? path : path + "/" } else { return path } } ``` See more about the configuration imports available from `astro:config/client`: * [`i18n`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18n) * [`trailingSlash`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) * [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) * [`build.format`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildformat) * [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) * [`compressHTML`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#compresshtml) ## Imports from `astro:config/server` [Section titled “Imports from astro:config/server”](#imports-from-astroconfigserver) ```js import { i18n, trailingSlash, base, build, site, srcDir, cacheDir, outDir, publicDir, root, compressHTML, } from "astro:config/server"; ``` These imports include everything available from `astro:config/client` as well as additional sensitive information about your file system configuration that is not safe to expose to the client. Use this submodule for server side code: astro.config.mjs ```js import { integration } from "./integration.mjs"; export default defineConfig({ integrations: [ integration(), ] }); ``` integration.mjs ```diff +import { outDir } from "astro:config/server"; import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs"; import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url"; export default function() { return { name: "internal-integration", hooks: { "astro:build:done": () => { let file = new URL("result.json", outDir); // generate data from some operation let data = JSON.stringify([]); writeFileSync(fileURLToPath(file), data, "utf-8"); } } } } ``` See more about the configuration imports available from `astro:config/server`: * [`i18n`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18n) * [`trailingSlash`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) * [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) * [`build.format`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildformat) * [`build.client`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildclient) * [`build.server`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildserver) * [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) * [`srcDir`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#srcdir) * [`cacheDir`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#cachedir) * [`outDir`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#outdir) * [`publicDir`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#publicdir) * [`root`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#root) * [`compressHTML`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#compresshtml)

# Content Collections API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` Content collections offer APIs to configure and query your Markdown or MDX documents in `src/content/`. For features and usage examples, [see our content collections guide](/en/guides/content-collections/). ## Imports from `astro:content` [Section titled “Imports from astro:content”](#imports-from-astrocontent) ```js import { defineCollection, getCollection, getEntry, getEntries, reference, render } from 'astro:content'; ``` ### `defineCollection()` [Section titled “defineCollection()”](#definecollection) **Type:** `(input: CollectionConfig) => CollectionConfig` **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` `defineCollection()` is a utility to configure a collection in a `src/content.config.*` file. src/content.config.ts ```ts import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content'; import { glob } from 'astro/loaders'; const blog = defineCollection({ loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md', base: './src/data/blog' }), schema: z.object({ title: z.string(), permalink: z.string().optional(), }), }); // Expose your defined collection to Astro // with the `collections` export export const collections = { blog }; ``` This function accepts the following properties: #### `loader` [Section titled “loader”](#loader) **Type:** `() => Promise<Array<{ id: string, [key: string]: any }> | Record<string, Record<string, any>>> | Loader` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A `loader` is either an object or a function that allows you to load data from any source, local or remote, into content collections. [See the `Content Collection` guide](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-the-collection-loader) for example usage. #### `schema` [Section titled “schema”](#schema) **Type:** `ZodType | (context: SchemaContext) => ZodType` **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` `schema` is an optional Zod object to configure the type and shape of document frontmatter for a collection. Each value must use [a Zod validator](/en/reference/modules/astro-zod/#common-data-type-validators). [See the `Content Collection` guide](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-the-collection-schema) for example usage. ### `reference()` [Section titled “reference()”](#reference) **Type:** `(collection: string) => ZodEffects<ZodString, { collection, id: string }>` **Added in:** `astro@2.5.0` The `reference()` function is used in the content config to define a relationship, or “reference,” from one collection to another. This accepts a collection name and transforms the reference into an object containing the collection name and the reference id. This example defines references from a blog author to the `authors` collection and an array of related posts to the same `blog` collection: ```ts import { defineCollection, reference, z } from 'astro:content'; import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders'; const blog = defineCollection({ loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md', base: './src/data/blog' }), schema: z.object({ // Reference a single author from the `authors` collection by `id` author: reference('authors'), // Reference an array of related posts from the `blog` collection by `slug` relatedPosts: z.array(reference('blog')), }) }); const authors = defineCollection({ loader: file("src/data/authors.json"), schema: z.object({ /* ... */ }) }); export const collections = { blog, authors }; ``` Validation of referenced entries happens at runtime when using `getEntry()` or `getEntries()`: src/pages/\[posts].astro ```astro // if a referenced entry is invalid, this will return undefined. const relatedPosts = await getEntries(blogPost.data.relatedPosts); ``` [See the `Content Collection` guide](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-collection-references) for example usage. ### `getCollection()` [Section titled “getCollection()”](#getcollection) **Type:** `(collection: string, filter?: (entry: CollectionEntry<collection>) => boolean) => CollectionEntry<collection>[]` **Added in:** `astro@2.0.0` `getCollection()` is a function that retrieves a list of content collection entries by collection name. It returns all items in the collection by default, and accepts an optional `filter` function to narrow by entry properties. This allows you to query for only some items in a collection based on `id` or frontmatter values via the `data` object. ```astro --- import { getCollection } from 'astro:content'; // Get all `src/content/blog/` entries const allBlogPosts = await getCollection('blog'); // Only return posts with `draft: true` in the frontmatter const draftBlogPosts = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => { return data.draft === true; }); --- ``` [See the `Content Collection` guide](/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections) for example usage. ### `getEntry()` [Section titled “getEntry()”](#getentry) **Types:** * `(collection: string, id: string) => Promise<CollectionEntry<collection> | undefined>` * `({ collection: string, id: string }) => Promise<CollectionEntry<collection> | undefined>` **Added in:** `astro@2.5.0` `getEntry()` is a function that retrieves a single collection entry by collection name and the entry `id`. `getEntry()` can also be used to get referenced entries to access the `data` or `body` properties: ```astro --- import { getEntry } from 'astro:content'; // Get `src/content/blog/enterprise.md` const enterprisePost = await getEntry('blog', 'enterprise'); // Get `src/content/captains/picard.json` const picardProfile = await getEntry('captains', 'picard'); // Get the profile referenced by `data.captain` const enterpriseCaptainProfile = await getEntry(enterprisePost.data.captain); --- ``` See the `Content Collections` guide for examples of [querying collection entries](/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections). ### `getEntries()` [Section titled “getEntries()”](#getentries) **Type:** `(Array<{ collection: string, id: string }>) => Array<CollectionEntry<collection>>` **Added in:** `astro@2.5.0` `getEntries()` is a function that retrieves multiple collection entries from the same collection. This is useful for [returning an array of referenced entries](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-collection-references) to access their associated `data` and `body` properties. ```astro --- import { getEntries, getEntry } from 'astro:content'; const enterprisePost = await getEntry('blog', 'enterprise'); // Get related posts referenced by `data.relatedPosts` const enterpriseRelatedPosts = await getEntries(enterprisePost.data.relatedPosts); --- ``` ### `render()` [Section titled “render()”](#render) **Type:** `(entry: CollectionEntry) => Promise<RenderedEntry>` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` A function to compile a given entry for rendering. This returns the following properties: * `<Content />` - A component used to render the document’s contents in an Astro file. * `headings` - A generated list of headings, [mirroring Astro’s `getHeadings()` utility](/en/guides/markdown-content/#available-properties) on Markdown and MDX imports. * `remarkPluginFrontmatter `- The modified frontmatter object after any [remark or rehype plugins have been applied](/en/guides/markdown-content/#modifying-frontmatter-programmatically). Set to type `any`. ```astro --- import { getEntry, render } from 'astro:content'; const entry = await getEntry('blog', 'entry-1'); if (!entry) { // Handle Error, for example: throw new Error('Could not find blog post 1'); } const { Content, headings, remarkPluginFrontmatter } = await render(entry); --- ``` [See the `Content Collection` guide](/en/guides/content-collections/#rendering-body-content) for example usage. ## `astro:content` types [Section titled “astro:content types”](#astrocontent-types) ```ts import type { CollectionEntry, CollectionKey, ContentCollectionKey, DataCollectionKey, SchemaContext, } from 'astro:content'; ``` ### `CollectionEntry` [Section titled “CollectionEntry”](#collectionentry) Query functions including [`getCollection()`](#getcollection), [`getEntry()`](#getentry), and [`getEntries()`](#getentries) each return entries with the `CollectionEntry` type. This type is available as a utility from `astro:content`: ```ts import type { CollectionEntry } from 'astro:content'; ``` `CollectionEntry` is a generic type. Use it with the name of the collection you’re querying. For example, an entry in your `blog` collection would have the type `CollectionEntry<'blog'>`. Each `CollectionEntry` is an object with the following values: #### `id` [Section titled “id”](#id) **Type:** `string` A unique ID. Note that all IDs from Astro’s built-in `glob()` loader are slugified. #### `collection` [Section titled “collection”](#collection) **Example Type:** `'blog' | 'authors' | ...` The name of a collection in which entries are located. This is the name used to reference the collection in your schema, and in querying functions. #### `data` [Section titled “data”](#data) **Type:** `CollectionSchema<TCollectionName>` An object of frontmatter properties inferred from your collection schema ([see `defineCollection()` reference](#definecollection)). Defaults to `any` if no schema is configured. #### `body` [Section titled “body”](#body) **Type:** `string | undefined` A string containing the raw, uncompiled body of the Markdown or MDX document. Note that if [`retainBody`](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#retainbody) is set to `false`, this value will be `undefined` instead of containing the raw file contents. ### `CollectionKey` [Section titled “CollectionKey”](#collectionkey) **Added in:** `astro@3.1.0` A string union of all collection names defined in your `src/content.config.*` file. This type can be useful when defining a generic function wrapping the built-in `getCollection()`. ```ts import { type CollectionKey, getCollection } from 'astro:content'; async function queryCollection(collection: CollectionKey) { return getCollection(collection, ({ data }) => { return data.draft !== true; }); } ``` ### `SchemaContext` [Section titled “SchemaContext”](#schemacontext) The `context` object that `defineCollection` uses for the function shape of `schema`. This type can be useful when building reusable schemas for multiple collections. This includes the following property: * `image` - The `image()` schema helper that allows you [to use local images in Content Collections](/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections) ```ts import { defineCollection, z, type SchemaContext } from "astro:content"; export const imageSchema = ({ image }: SchemaContext) => z.object({ image: image(), description: z.string().optional(), }); const blog = defineCollection({ loader: /* ... */, schema: ({ image }) => z.object({ title: z.string(), permalink: z.string().optional(), image: imageSchema({ image }) }), }); ```

# Environment Variables API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The `astro:env` API lets you configure a type-safe schema for environment variables you have set. This allows you to indicate whether they should be available on the server or the client, and define their data type and additional properties. For examples and usage instructions, [see the `astro:env` guide](/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables). ## Imports from `astro:env` [Section titled “Imports from astro:env”](#imports-from-astroenv) ```js import { getSecret, } from 'astro:env/server'; ``` ### `getSecret()` [Section titled “getSecret()”](#getsecret) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The `getSecret()` helper function allows retrieving the raw value of an environment variable by its key. For example, you can retrieve a boolean value as a string: ```js import { FEATURE_FLAG, // boolean getSecret } from 'astro:env/server' getSecret('FEATURE_FLAG') // string | undefined ``` This can also be useful to get a secret not defined in your schema, for example one that depends on dynamic data from a database or API. If you need to retrieve environment variables programmatically, we recommend using `getSecret()` instead of `process.env` (or equivalent). Because its implementation is provided by your adapter, you won’t need to update all your calls if you switch adapters. It defaults to `process.env` in dev and build.

# Internationalization API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` This module provides functions to help you create URLs using your project’s configured locales. Creating routes for your project with the i18n router will depend on certain configuration values you have set that affect your page routes. When creating routes with these functions, be sure to take into account your individual settings for: * [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) * [`trailingSlash`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) * [`build.format`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildformat) * [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) Also, note that the returned URLs created by these functions for your `defaultLocale` will reflect your `i18n.routing` configuration. For features and usage examples, [see our i18n routing guide](/en/guides/internationalization/). ## Imports from `astro:i18n` [Section titled “Imports from astro:i18n”](#imports-from-astroi18n) ```js import { getRelativeLocaleUrl, getAbsoluteLocaleUrl, getRelativeLocaleUrlList, getAbsoluteLocaleUrlList, getPathByLocale, getLocaleByPath, redirectToDefaultLocale, redirectToFallback, notFound, middleware, requestHasLocale, normalizeTheLocale, pathHasLocale, toCodes, toPaths } from 'astro:i18n'; ``` ### `getRelativeLocaleUrl()` [Section titled “getRelativeLocaleUrl()”](#getrelativelocaleurl) **Type:** `(locale: string, path?: string, options?: GetLocaleOptions) => string` Use this function to retrieve a relative path for a locale. If the locale doesn’t exist, Astro throws an error. ```astro --- import { getRelativeLocaleUrl } from 'astro:i18n'; getRelativeLocaleUrl("fr"); // returns /fr getRelativeLocaleUrl("fr", ""); // returns /fr/ getRelativeLocaleUrl("fr", "getting-started"); // returns /fr/getting-started getRelativeLocaleUrl("fr_CA", "getting-started", { prependWith: "blog" }); // returns /blog/fr-ca/getting-started getRelativeLocaleUrl("fr_CA", "getting-started", { prependWith: "blog", normalizeLocale: false }); // returns /blog/fr_CA/getting-started --- ``` ### `getAbsoluteLocaleUrl()` [Section titled “getAbsoluteLocaleUrl()”](#getabsolutelocaleurl) **Type:** `(locale: string, path?: string, options?: GetLocaleOptions) => string` Use this function to retrieve an absolute path for a locale when \[`site`] has a value. If \[`site`] isn’t configured, the function returns a relative URL. If the locale doesn’t exist, Astro throws an error. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { getAbsoluteLocaleUrl } from 'astro:i18n'; // If `site` is set to be `https://example.com` getAbsoluteLocaleUrl("fr"); // returns https://example.com/fr getAbsoluteLocaleUrl("fr", ""); // returns https://example.com/fr/ getAbsoluteLocaleUrl("fr", "getting-started"); // returns https://example.com/fr/getting-started getAbsoluteLocaleUrl("fr_CA", "getting-started", { prependWith: "blog" }); // returns https://example.com/blog/fr-ca/getting-started getAbsoluteLocaleUrl("fr_CA", "getting-started", { prependWith: "blog", normalizeLocale: false }); // returns https://example.com/blog/fr_CA/getting-started --- ``` ### `getRelativeLocaleUrlList()` [Section titled “getRelativeLocaleUrlList()”](#getrelativelocaleurllist) **Type:** `(path?: string, options?: GetLocaleOptions) => string[]` Use this like [`getRelativeLocaleUrl`](#getrelativelocaleurl) to return a list of relative paths for all the locales. ### `getAbsoluteLocaleUrlList()` [Section titled “getAbsoluteLocaleUrlList()”](#getabsolutelocaleurllist) **Type:** `(path?: string, options?: GetLocaleOptions) => string[]` Use this like [`getAbsoluteLocaleUrl`](/en/guides/internationalization/#custom-locale-paths) to return a list of absolute paths for all the locales. ### `getPathByLocale()` [Section titled “getPathByLocale()”](#getpathbylocale) **Type:** `(locale: string) => string` A function that returns the `path` associated to one or more `codes` when [custom locale paths](/en/guides/internationalization/#custom-locale-paths) are configured. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { locales: ["es", "en", { path: "french", codes: ["fr", "fr-BR", "fr-CA"] }] } }) ``` src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { getPathByLocale } from 'astro:i18n'; getPathByLocale("fr"); // returns "french" getPathByLocale("fr-CA"); // returns "french" --- ``` ### `getLocaleByPath()` [Section titled “getLocaleByPath()”](#getlocalebypath) **Type:** `(path: string) => string` A function that returns the `code` associated to a locale `path`. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { locales: ["es", "en", { path: "french", codes: ["fr", "fr-BR", "fr-CA"] }] } }) ``` src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { getLocaleByPath } from 'astro:i18n'; getLocaleByPath("french"); // returns "fr" because that's the first code configured --- ``` ### `redirectToDefaultLocale()` [Section titled “redirectToDefaultLocale()”](#redirecttodefaultlocale) **Type:** `(context: APIContext, statusCode?: ValidRedirectStatus) => Promise<Response>` **Added in:** `astro@4.6.0` A function that returns a `Response` that redirects to the `defaultLocale` configured.

This is useful when you still want to use the default i18n logic, but add only a few exceptions to your website. middleware.js ```js import { middleware } from "astro:i18n"; import { sequence, defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware"; const customLogic = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { const response = await next(); // Custom logic after resolving the response. // It's possible to catch the response coming from Astro i18n middleware. return response; }); export const onRequest = sequence(customLogic, middleware({ prefixDefaultLocale: true, redirectToDefaultLocale: false })) ``` ### `requestHasLocale()` [Section titled “requestHasLocale()”](#requesthaslocale) **Type:** `(context: APIContext) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@4.6.0` Checks whether the current URL contains a configured locale. Internally, this function will use `APIContext#url.pathname`. middleware.js ```js import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware"; import { requestHasLocale } from "astro:i18n"; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => { if (requestHasLocale(context)) { return next(); } return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 }); }) ``` ### `normalizeTheLocale()` [Section titled “normalizeTheLocale()”](#normalizethelocale) **Type:** `(locale: string) => string` Replaces underscores (`_`) with hyphens (`-`) in the given locale before returning a lowercase version. src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { normalizeTheLocale } from "astro:i18n"; normalizeTheLocale("it_VT") // returns `it-vt` // Assuming the current locale is `"pt-PT"`: normalizeTheLocale(Astro.currentLocale) // returns `pt-pt` --- ``` ### `pathHasLocale()` [Section titled “pathHasLocale()”](#pathhaslocale) **Type:** `(path: string) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@4.6.0` Checks whether the given path contains a configured locale. This is useful to prevent errors before using an i18n utility that relies on a locale from a URL path. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { locales: [ { codes: ["it-VT", "it"], path: "italiano" }, "es" ] } }) ``` src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { pathHasLocale } from "astro:i18n"; pathHasLocale("italiano"); // returns `true` pathHasLocale("es"); // returns `true` pathHasLocale('/es/blog/'); // returns `true` pathHasLocale("it-VT"); // returns `false` --- ``` ### `toCodes()` [Section titled “toCodes()”](#tocodes) **Type:** `(locales: Locales) => string[]` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Retrieves the configured locale codes for each locale defined in your configuration. When multiple codes are associated to a locale, only the first one will be added to the array. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { locales: [ { codes: ["it-VT", "it"], path: "italiano" }, "es" ] } }) ``` src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { i18n } from "astro:config/client"; import { toCodes } from "astro:i18n"; toCodes(i18n!.locales); // ["it-VT", "es"] --- ``` ### `toPaths()` [Section titled “toPaths()”](#topaths) **Type:** `(locales: Locales) => string[]` **Added in:** `astro@4.0.0` Retrieves the configured locale paths for each locale defined in your configuration. astro.config.mjs ```js export default defineConfig({ i18n: { locales: [ { codes: ["it-VT", "it"], path: "italiano" }, "es" ] } }) ``` src/pages/index.astro ```astro --- import { i18n } from "astro:config/client"; import { toPaths } from "astro:i18n"; toPaths(i18n!.locales); // ["italiano", "es"] --- ```

# Middleware API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@2.6.0` Middleware allows you to intercept requests and responses and inject behaviors dynamically every time a page or endpoint is about to be rendered. For features and usage examples, [see our middleware guide](/en/guides/middleware/). ## Imports from `astro:middleware` [Section titled “Imports from astro:middleware”](#imports-from-astromiddleware) The following helpers are imported from the virtual middleware module: ```js import { defineMiddleware, sequence, } from 'astro:middleware'; ``` ### `defineMiddleware()` [Section titled “defineMiddleware()”](#definemiddleware) **Type:** `(fn: MiddlewareHandler) => MiddlewareHandler` A function for defining a middleware function with type safety. When you use this utility, the [`context`](#context) and [`next()`](#next) arguments are automatically typed, and you will get a Typescript error if you try to return a [value not supported in your middleware](#middlewarehandler). src/middleware.ts ```ts import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware"; export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => { /* your middleware logic */ }); ``` ### `sequence()` [Section titled “sequence()”](#sequence) **Type:** `(…handlers: MiddlewareHandler[]) => MiddlewareHandler` A function that accepts middleware functions as arguments, and will execute them in the order in which they are passed. src/middleware.js ```js import { sequence } from "astro:middleware"; async function validation(context, next) {/* ... */} async function auth(context, next) {/* ... */} async function greeting(context, next) {/* ... */} export const onRequest = sequence(validation, auth, greeting); ``` ## Imports from `astro/middleware` [Section titled “Imports from astro/middleware”](#imports-from-astromiddleware-1) The following helpers can be imported from the regular middleware module when you build an [Astro Integration](/en/reference/integrations-reference/): ```js import { createContext, defineMiddleware, sequence, trySerializeLocals, } from "astro/middleware"; ``` ### `createContext()` [Section titled “createContext()”](#createcontext) **Type:** `(context: CreateContext) => APIContext` **Added in:** `astro@2.8.0` A low-level API to create an [`APIContext`](/en/reference/api-reference/)to be passed to an Astro middleware [`onRequest()` function](#onrequest). This function can be used by integrations/adapters to programmatically execute the Astro middleware. ### `defineMiddleware()` [Section titled “defineMiddleware()”](#definemiddleware-1) See [`defineMiddleware()`](#definemiddleware) from `astro:middleware`. ### `sequence()` [Section titled “sequence()”](#sequence-1) See [`sequence()`](#sequence) from `astro:middleware`. ### `trySerializeLocals()` [Section titled “trySerializeLocals()”](#tryserializelocals) **Type:** `(value: unknown) => string` **Added in:** `astro@2.8.0` A low-level API that takes in any value and tries to return a serialized version (a string) of it. If the value cannot be serialized, the function will throw a runtime error. ## `astro/middleware` types [Section titled “astro/middleware types”](#astromiddleware-types) The following types are imported from the regular middleware module: ```js import type { CreateContext, } from "astro/middleware"; ``` ### `CreateContext` [Section titled “CreateContext”](#createcontext-1) **Type:** `{ request: Request; params?: Params; userDefinedLocales?: string[]; defaultLocale: string; locals: App.Locals; }` **Added in:** `astro@2.8.0` An object to [create a context](#createcontext) to be passed to an Astro middleware. This contains the following properties: #### `request` [Section titled “request”](#request) **Type:** `Request` The incoming [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object. #### `params` [Section titled “params”](#params) **Type:** `Params` An object containing the optional parameters to be passed to [`Astro.params`](/en/reference/api-reference/#params). #### `userDefinedLocales` [Section titled “userDefinedLocales”](#userdefinedlocales) **Type:** `string[]` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` A list of supported locales defined in the [user’s `i18n` configuration](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18nlocales). #### `defaultLocale` [Section titled “defaultLocale”](#defaultlocale) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@4.16.0` The default locale defined in the [user’s `i18n` configuration](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18ndefaultlocale). #### `locals` [Section titled “locals”](#locals) **Type:** `App.Locals` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` An object for storing arbitrary information from a middleware, accessible to the user via [`Astro.locals`](/en/reference/api-reference/#locals). Learn more about [storing data in `locals`](/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals) with example usage. ## `astro` types [Section titled “astro types”](#astro-types) ```js import type { MiddlewareHandler, MiddlewareNext, RewritePayload, } from "astro"; ``` ### `MiddlewareHandler` [Section titled “MiddlewareHandler”](#middlewarehandler) **Type:** `(context: APIContext, next: MiddlewareNext) => Promise<Response> | Response | Promise<void> | void` Represents an Astro middleware function. Middleware handlers receive two arguments and can either return a `Response` directly or call `next()` to invoke the next middleware in the chain. Alternatively, you can use [`defineMiddleware()`](#definemiddleware) to get type safety for your middleware. The following example imports the `MiddlewareHandler` type to get type safety in the [`onRequest()`](#onrequest) function: src/middleware.ts ```ts import type { MiddlewareHandler } from "astro"; export const onRequest: MiddlewareHandler = (context, next) => { /* the middleware logic */ }; ``` A middleware handler receives the following properties: #### `context` [Section titled “context”](#context) **Type:** [`APIContext`](/en/reference/api-reference/) An [Astro context](/en/reference/api-reference/) object mirroring many of the `Astro` global properties. #### `next()` [Section titled “next()”](#next) **Type:** [`MiddlewareNext`](#middlewarenext) A function that calls all the subsequent middleware in the chain and returns a `Response`. For example, other middleware could modify the HTML body of a response and awaiting the result of `next()` would allow your middleware to respond to those changes. Since Astro v4.13.0, `next()` accepts an optional URL path parameter in the form of a string, `URL`, or `Request` to [rewrite](/en/guides/routing/#rewrites) the current request without retriggering a new rendering phase. The following example uses `next()` to serve content from a different path when the current path matches `/old-path`: src/middleware.ts ```ts import type { MiddlewareHandler } from "astro"; export const onRequest: MiddlewareHandler = (context, next) => { if (context.url.pathname === '/old-path') { return next('/new-path'); } return next(); }; ``` ### `MiddlewareNext` [Section titled “MiddlewareNext”](#middlewarenext) **Type:** `(rewritePayload?: RewritePayload) => Promise<Response>` Represents the [`next()` function](#next) passed to middleware handlers. ### `RewritePayload` [Section titled “RewritePayload”](#rewritepayload) **Type:** `string | URL | Request` **Added in:** `astro@4.13.0` Represents the destination for a [rewrite](/en/guides/routing/#rewrites) when passed to the [`next()`](#next) function. ## Middleware exports [Section titled “Middleware exports”](#middleware-exports) When defining your project’s middleware in `src/middleware.js`, export the following user-defined functions: ### `onRequest()` [Section titled “onRequest()”](#onrequest) **Type:** [`MiddlewareHandler`](#middlewarehandler) A required exported function from `src/middleware.js` that will be called before rendering every page or API route. It receives two arguments: [`context`](#context) and [`next()`](#next). `onRequest()` must return a `Response`: either directly, or by calling `next()`. src/middleware.js ```js export function onRequest (context, next) { // intercept response data from a request // optionally, transform the response // return a Response directly, or the result of calling `next()` return next(); }; ```

# View Transitions Router API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@3.0.0` These modules provide functions to control and interact with the View Transitions API and client-side router. For features and usage examples, [see our View Transitions guide](/en/guides/view-transitions/). ## Imports from `astro:transitions` [Section titled “Imports from astro:transitions”](#imports-from-astrotransitions) ```ts import { ClientRouter, fade, slide, } from 'astro:transitions'; ``` ### `<ClientRouter />` [Section titled “\<ClientRouter />”](#clientrouter-) **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` Opt in to using view transitions on individual pages by importing and adding the `<ClientRouter />` routing component to `<head>` on every desired page. src/pages/index.astro ```diff --- +import { ClientRouter } from 'astro:transitions'; --- <html lang="en"> <head> <title>My Homepage</title> +<ClientRouter /> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1> </body> </html> ``` See more about how to [control the router](/en/guides/view-transitions/#router-control) and [add transition directives](/en/guides/view-transitions/#transition-directives) to page elements and components. The `<ClientRouter />` component accepts the following props: #### `fallback` **Type:** [`Fallback`](#fallback)\ **Default:** `animate` Defines the fallback strategy to use for browsers that do not support the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API). ### `fade` [Section titled “fade”](#fade) **Type:** `(opts: { duration?: string | number }) => TransitionDirectionalAnimations` **Added in:** `astro@3.0.0` Utility function to support customizing the duration of the built-in `fade` animation. ```astro --- import { fade } from 'astro:transitions'; --- <!-- Fade transition with the default duration --> <div transition:animate="fade" /> <!-- Fade transition with a duration of 400 milliseconds --> <div transition:animate={fade({ duration: '0.4s' })} /> ``` ### `slide` [Section titled “slide”](#slide) **Type:** `(opts: { duration?: string | number }) => TransitionDirectionalAnimations` **Added in:** `astro@3.0.0` Utility function to support customizing the duration of the built-in `slide` animation. ```astro --- import { slide } from 'astro:transitions'; --- <!-- Slide transition with the default duration --> <div transition:animate="slide" /> <!-- Slide transition with a duration of 400 milliseconds --> <div transition:animate={slide({ duration: '0.4s' })} /> ``` ## Imports from `astro:transitions/client` [Section titled “Imports from astro:transitions/client”](#imports-from-astrotransitionsclient) ```ts import { getFallback, navigate, supportsViewTransitions, swapFunctions, transitionEnabledOnThisPage, /* The following are scheduled for deprecation in v6: */ isTransitionBeforePreparationEvent, isTransitionBeforeSwapEvent, TRANSITION_AFTER_PREPARATION, TRANSITION_AFTER_SWAP, TRANSITION_BEFORE_PREPARATION, TRANSITION_BEFORE_SWAP, TRANSITION_PAGE_LOAD, } from 'astro:transitions/client'; ``` ### `navigate()` [Section titled “navigate()”](#navigate) **Type:** `(href: string, options?: Options) => void` **Added in:** `astro@3.2.0` Executes a navigation to the given `href` using the View Transitions API. This function signature is based on the [`navigate` function from the browser Navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate). Although based on the Navigation API, this function is implemented on top of the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) to allow for navigation without reloading the page. `navigate()` does not perform sanitization on the `href` parameter. [Sanitize user input](/en/guides/view-transitions/#navigating-with-user-input) if you use it to determine the URL to navigate to. #### `history` option [Section titled “history option”](#history-option) **Type:** `'auto' | 'push' | 'replace'`\ **Default:** `'auto'` **Added in:** `astro@3.2.0` Defines how this navigation should be added to the browser history. * `'push'`: the router will use `history.pushState` to create a new entry in the browser history. * `'replace'`: the router will use `history.replaceState` to update the URL without adding a new entry into navigation. * `'auto'` (default): the router will attempt `history.pushState`, but if the URL cannot be transitioned to, the current URL will remain with no changes to the browser history. This option follows the [`history` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate#history) from the browser Navigation API but simplified for the cases that can happen on an Astro project. #### `formData` option [Section titled “formData option”](#formdata-option) **Type:** `FormData` **Added in:** `astro@3.5.0` A `FormData` object for `POST` requests. When this option is provided, the requests to the navigation target page will be sent as a `POST` request with the form data object as the content. Submitting an HTML form with view transitions enabled will use this method instead of the default navigation with page reload. Calling this method allows triggering the same behavior programmatically. #### `info` option [Section titled “info option”](#info-option) **Type:** `any` **Added in:** `astro@3.6.0` Arbitrary data to be included in the `astro:before-preparation` and `astro:before-swap` events caused by this navigation. This option mimics the [`info` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate#info) from the browser Navigation API. #### `state` option [Section titled “state option”](#state-option) **Type:** `any` **Added in:** `astro@3.6.0` Arbitrary data to be associated with the `NavigationHistoryEntry` object created by this navigation. This data can then be retrieved using the [`history.getState` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationHistoryEntry/getState) from the History API. This option mimics the [`state` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate#state) from the browser Navigation API. #### `sourceElement` option [Section titled “sourceElement option”](#sourceelement-option) **Type:** `Element` **Added in:** `astro@3.6.0` The element that triggered this navigation, if any. This element will be available in the following events: * [`astro:before-preparation`](#astrobefore-preparation-event) * [`astro:before-swap`](#astrobefore-swap-event) ### `supportsViewTransitions` [Section titled “supportsViewTransitions”](#supportsviewtransitions) **Type:** `boolean` **Added in:** `astro@3.2.0` Whether or not view transitions are supported and enabled in the current browser. ### `transitionEnabledOnThisPage()` [Section titled “transitionEnabledOnThisPage()”](#transitionenabledonthispage) **Type:** `() => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@3.2.0` Whether or not the current page has view transitions enabled for client-side navigation. This can be used to make components that behave differently when they are used on pages with view transitions. ### `getFallback()` [Section titled “getFallback()”](#getfallback) **Type:** `() => Fallback`\ **Default:** `animate` **Added in:** `astro@3.6.0` Returns the fallback strategy to use (`animate` by default) in browsers that do not support view transitions. See the guide on [Fallback control](/en/guides/view-transitions/#fallback-control) for how to choose and configure the fallback behavior. ### `swapFunctions` [Section titled “swapFunctions”](#swapfunctions) **Type:** `object` **Added in:** `astro@4.15.0` An object containing the utility functions used to build Astro’s default swap function. These can be useful when [building a custom swap function](/en/guides/view-transitions/#building-a-custom-swap-function). `swapFunctions` provides the following methods: #### `deselectScripts()` [Section titled “deselectScripts()”](#deselectscripts) **Type:** `(newDocument: Document) => void` Marks scripts in the new document that should not be executed. Those scripts are already in the current document and are not flagged for re-execution using [`data-astro-rerun`](/en/guides/view-transitions/#data-astro-rerun). #### `swapRootAttributes()` [Section titled “swapRootAttributes()”](#swaprootattributes) **Type:** `(newDocument: Document) => void` Swaps the attributes between the document roots, like the `lang` attribute. This also includes Astro-injected internal attributes like `data-astro-transition`, which makes the transition direction available to Astro-generated CSS rules. When making a custom swap function, it is important to call this function so as not to break the view transition’s animations. #### `swapHeadElements()` [Section titled “swapHeadElements()”](#swapheadelements) **Type:** `(newDocument: Document) => void` Removes every element from the current document’s `<head>` that is not persisted to the new document. Then appends all new elements from the new document’s `<head>` to the current document’s `<head>`. #### `saveFocus()` [Section titled “saveFocus()”](#savefocus) **Type:** `() => () => void` Stores the element in focus on the current page and returns a function that when called, if the focused element was persisted, returns the focus to it. #### `swapBodyElement()` [Section titled “swapBodyElement()”](#swapbodyelement) **Type:** `(newBody: Element, oldBody: Element) => void` Replaces the old body with the new body. Then, goes through every element in the old body that should be persisted and have a matching element in the new body and swaps the old element back in place. ### Deprecated imports [Section titled “Deprecated imports”](#deprecated-imports) The following imports are scheduled for deprecation in v6. You can still use them in your project, but you may prefer to update your code now. #### `isTransitionBeforePreparationEvent()` **Type:** `(value: any) => boolean` **Added in:** `astro@3.6.0` Scheduled for deprecation This function is scheduled for deprecation in v6.

The direction of the traversal is given on the [`direction` attribute](#direction-1). #### `direction` [Section titled “direction”](#direction-1) **Type:** `string` The direction of the transition: * In an [`astro:before-preparation` event](#astrobefore-preparation-event), this can be used to define custom directions. The property is writable and accepts any string. * In an [`astro:before-swap` event](#astrobefore-swap-event), this can be used to retrieve the transition direction. The property is readonly and its value can be a predefined [`Direction`](#direction) or any string that an `astro:before-preparation` event listener might have set. #### `from` [Section titled “from”](#from) **Type:** `URL` The URL of the page initiating the navigation. #### `to` [Section titled “to”](#to) **Type:** `URL` The URL of the page being navigated to. This property can be modified, the value at the end of the lifecycle will be used in the `NavigationHistoryEntry` for the next page. #### `formData` [Section titled “formData”](#formdata) **Type:** `FormData | undefined`\ **Available in:** [`astro:before-preparation` event](#astrobefore-preparation-event) When set, a `POST` request will be sent to the [`to` URL](#to) with the given `FormData` object as the content instead of the normal `GET` request. When submitting an HTML form with view transitions enabled, this field is automatically set to the data in the form. When using the [`navigate()` function](#navigate), this value is the same as given in the options. #### `loader()` [Section titled “loader()”](#loader) **Type:** `() => Promise<void>`\ **Available in:** [`astro:before-preparation` event](#astrobefore-preparation-event) Implementation of the following phase in the navigation (loading the next page). This implementation can be overridden to add extra behavior. #### `viewTransition` [Section titled “viewTransition”](#viewtransition) **Type:** [`ViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition)\ **Available in:** [`astro:before-swap` event](#astrobefore-swap-event) The view transition object used in this navigation. On browsers that do not support the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API), this is an object implementing the same API for convenience but without the DOM integration. #### `swap()` [Section titled “swap()”](#swap) **Type:** `() => void`\ **Available in:** [`astro:before-swap` event](#astrobefore-swap-event) Calls the default document swap logic. By default, this implementation will call the following functions in order: 1. [`deselectScripts()`](#deselectscripts) 2. [`swapRootAttributes()`](#swaprootattributes) 3. [`swapHeadElements()`](#swapheadelements) 4. [`saveFocus()`](#savefocus) 5. [`swapBodyElement()`](#swapbodyelement) Read more about [building a custom swap function](/en/guides/view-transitions/#building-a-custom-swap-function) in the View Transitions guide.

# Zod API Reference

[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) is a TypeScript-based schema declaration and validation library. This allows you to define schemas you can use to validate data and transform data, from a simple type (e.g. `string`, `number`) to complex data structures (e.g. nested objects). The `astro/zod` module exposes a re-export of Zod that gives you access to all the features of Zod v3. By using this module, you do not need to install Zod yourself. This also ensures that your project uses the same API versions as Astro when using features such as [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) or [Actions](/en/guides/actions/). See [Zod v3 website](https://v3.zod.dev/) for complete documentation on how Zod works and what features are available. ## Imports from `astro/zod` [Section titled “Imports from astro/zod”](#imports-from-astrozod) ```ts import { z } from 'astro/zod'; ``` ### `z` [Section titled “z”](#z) **Type:** `object` The `z` utility gives you access to validators for a wide range of data types, methods and types for working with your data. Learn more about the `z` utility in [Zod documentation](https://v3.zod.dev/?id=basic-usage) #### Common data type validators [Section titled “Common data type validators”](#common-data-type-validators) With Zod, you can validate any type of data, such as [primitives](https://v3.zod.dev/?id=primitives), [objects](https://v3.zod.dev/?id=objects), [arrays](https://v3.zod.dev/?id=arrays) and more. The following example shows a cheatsheet of many common Zod data types to create a `user` schema: ```ts import { z } from 'astro/zod'; const user = z.object({ username: z.string(), name: z.string().min(2), email: z.string().email(), role: z.enum(["admin", "editor"]), language: z.enum(["en", "fr", "es"]).default("en"), hobbies: z.array(z.string()), age: z.number(), isEmailConfirmed: z.boolean(), inscriptionDate: z.date(), website: z.string().url().optional(), }); ``` #### Extracting a Typescript type [Section titled “Extracting a Typescript type”](#extracting-a-typescript-type) Zod allows you to create a Typescript type from any schema [using Zod type inference](https://v3.zod.dev/?id=type-inference). This can be useful for describing an expected data structure when [defining component props](/en/guides/typescript/#component-props). The following example create a `User` type based on the previous schema: ```ts type User = z.infer<typeof user>; /* The `User` type will be: * type User = { * username: string; * name: string; * email: string; * role: "admin" | "editor"; * language: "en" | "fr" | "es"; * hobbies: string[]; * age: number; * isEmailConfirmed: boolean; * inscriptionDate: Date; * website?: string | undefined; * } */ ``` #### Using Zod methods [Section titled “Using Zod methods”](#using-zod-methods) Zod provides various [schema methods](https://v3.zod.dev/?id=schema-methods) to customize error messages, transform data, or create custom validation logics. ```ts // Customize the error message const nonEmptyStrings = z.string().array().nonempty({ message: "Can't be empty!", }); // Validate a data from a schema nonEmptyStrings.parse([]); // will throws our custom error // Create an object from a URL for a decorative img const decorativeImg = z.string().transform((value) => { return { src: value, alt: "" }; }); // Create a custom validator and error message for a string const constrainedString = z .string() .refine((val) => val.length > 0 && val.length <= 255, { message: "Must be between 1 and 255 characters.", }); ``` ### Individual imports [Section titled “Individual imports”](#individual-imports) Alternatively, you can import all the Zod validators, methods and types available in the [`z` utility](#z) directly from the module. The following example imports `coerce` to create a `Date` object from a date string: ```ts import { coerce } from 'astro/zod'; const publishedOn = coerce.date(); const publicationDate = publishedOn.parse("2025-12-03"); ```

# Programmatic Astro API (experimental)

If you need more control when running Astro, the `"astro"` package exports APIs to programmatically run the CLI commands. These APIs are experimental and their API signature may change. Any updates will be mentioned in the [Astro changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) and the information below will always show the current, up-to-date information. ## `AstroInlineConfig` [Section titled “AstroInlineConfig”](#astroinlineconfig) The `AstroInlineConfig` type is used by all of the command APIs below. It extends from the user [Astro config](/en/reference/configuration-reference/) type: ```ts interface AstroInlineConfig extends AstroUserConfig { configFile?: string | false; mode?: string; logLevel?: "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "silent"; } ``` ### `configFile` [Section titled “configFile”](#configfile) **Type:** `string | false`\ **Default:** `undefined` A custom path to the Astro config file. If this value is undefined (default) or unset, Astro will search for an `astro.config.(js,mjs,ts,mts)` file relative to the `root` and load the config file if found. If a relative path is set, it will resolve based on the `root` option. Set to `false` to disable loading any config files. The inline config passed in this object will take highest priority when merging with the loaded user config. ### `mode` [Section titled “mode”](#mode) **Type:** `string`\ **Default:** `"development"` when running `astro dev`, `"production"` when running `astro build` **Added in:** `astro@5.0.0` The mode used when developing or building your site (e.g. `"production"`, `"testing"`). This value is passed to Vite using [the `--mode` flag](/en/reference/cli-reference/#--mode-string) when the `astro build` or `astro dev` commands are run to determine the value of `import.meta.env.MODE`. This also determines which `.env` files are loaded, and therefore the values of `astro:env`. See the [environment variables page](/en/guides/environment-variables/) for more details. To output a development-based build, you can run `astro build` with the [`--devOutput` flag](/en/reference/cli-reference/#--devoutput). ### `logLevel` [Section titled “logLevel”](#loglevel) **Type:** `"debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "silent"`\ **Default:** `"info"` The logging level to filter messages logged by Astro. * `"debug"`: Log everything, including noisy debugging diagnostics. * `"info"`: Log informational messages, warnings, and errors. * `"warn"`: Log warnings and errors. * `"error"`: Log errors only. * `"silent"`: No logging. ## `dev()` [Section titled “dev()”](#dev) **Type:** `(inlineConfig: AstroInlineConfig) => Promise<DevServer>` Similar to [`astro dev`](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev), it runs Astro’s development server. ```js import { dev } from "astro"; const devServer = await dev({ root: "./my-project", }); // Stop the server if needed await devServer.stop(); ``` ### `DevServer` [Section titled “DevServer”](#devserver) ```ts export interface DevServer { address: AddressInfo; handle: (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse<http.IncomingMessage>) => void; watcher: vite.FSWatcher; stop(): Promise<void>; } ``` #### `address` [Section titled “address”](#address) **Type:** `AddressInfo` The address the dev server is listening on. This property contains the value returned by Node’s [`net.Server#address()` method](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#serveraddress). #### `handle()` [Section titled “handle()”](#handle) **Type:** `(req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse<http.IncomingMessage>) => void` A handle for raw Node HTTP requests. You can call `handle()` with an [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage) and an [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse) instead of sending a request through the network. #### `watcher` [Section titled “watcher”](#watcher) **Type:** `vite.FSWatcher` The [Chokidar file watcher](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#getting-started) as exposed by [Vite’s development server](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript#vitedevserver). #### `stop()` [Section titled “stop()”](#stop) **Type:** `Promise<void>` Stops the development server. This closes all idle connections and stops listening for new connections. Returns a `Promise` that resolves once all pending requests have been fulfilled and all idle connections have been closed. ## `build()` [Section titled “build()”](#build) **Type:** `(inlineConfig: AstroInlineConfig, options?: BuildOptions) => Promise<void>` Similar to [`astro build`](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-build), it builds your site for deployment. ```js import { build } from "astro"; await build({ root: "./my-project", }); ``` ### `BuildOptions` [Section titled “BuildOptions”](#buildoptions) ```ts export interface BuildOptions { devOutput?: boolean; teardownCompiler?: boolean; } ``` #### `devOutput` [Section titled “devOutput”](#devoutput) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@5.4.0` Output a development-based build similar to code transformed in `astro dev`. This can be useful to test build-only issues with additional debugging information included. #### `teardownCompiler` [Section titled “teardownCompiler”](#teardowncompiler) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` **Added in:** `astro@5.4.0` Teardown the compiler WASM instance after build. This can improve performance when building once but may cause a performance hit if building multiple times in a row. When building multiple projects in the same execution (e.g. during tests), disabling this option can greatly increase performance and reduce peak memory usage at the cost of higher sustained memory usage. ## `preview()` [Section titled “preview()”](#preview) **Type:** `(inlineConfig: AstroInlineConfig) => Promise<PreviewServer>` Similar to [`astro preview`](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-preview), it starts a local server to serve your build output. If no adapter is set in the configuration, the preview server will only serve the built static files. If an adapter is set in the configuration, the preview server is provided by the adapter. Adapters are not required to provide a preview server, so this feature may not be available depending on your adapter of choice. ```js import { preview } from "astro"; const previewServer = await preview({ root: "./my-project", }); // Stop the server if needed await previewServer.stop(); ``` ### `PreviewServer` [Section titled “PreviewServer”](#previewserver) ```ts export interface PreviewServer { host?: string; port: number; closed(): Promise<void>; stop(): Promise<void>; } ``` #### `host` [Section titled “host”](#host) **Type:** `string` The host where the server is listening for connections. Adapters are allowed to leave this field unset. The value of `host` is implementation-specific. #### `port` [Section titled “port”](#port) **Type:** `number` The port where the server is listening for connections. #### `stop()` [Section titled “stop()”](#stop-1) **Type:** `Promise<void>` Asks the preview server to close, stop accepting requests, and drop idle connections. The returned `Promise` resolves when the close request has been sent. This does not mean that the server has closed yet. Use the [`closed()`](#closed) method if you need to ensure the server has fully closed. #### `closed()` [Section titled “closed()”](#closed) **Type:** `Promise<void>` Returns a `Promise` that will resolve once the server is closed and reject if an error happens on the server. ## `sync()` [Section titled “sync()”](#sync) **Type:** `(inlineConfig: AstroInlineConfig) => Promise<void>` Similar to [`astro sync`](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-sync), it generates TypeScript types for all Astro modules. ```js import { sync } from "astro"; await sync({ root: "./my-project", }); ``` ## `mergeConfig()` [Section titled “mergeConfig()”](#mergeconfig) **Type:** `<T extends AstroConfig | AstroInlineConfig>(config: T, overrides: DeepPartial<T>) => T` **Added in:** `astro@5.4.0` Imported from `astro/config`, merges a partial Astro configuration on top of an existing, valid, Astro configuration. `mergeConfig()` accepts an Astro config object and a partial config (any set of valid Astro config options), and returns a valid Astro config combining both values such that: * Arrays are concatenated (including integrations and remark plugins). * Objects are merged recursively. * Vite options are merged using [Vite’s own `mergeConfig` function](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript#mergeconfig) with the default `isRoot` flag. * Options that can be provided as functions are wrapped into new functions that recursively merge the return values from both configurations with these same rules. * All other options override the existing config. ```ts import { mergeConfig } from "astro/config"; mergeConfig( { output: 'static', site: 'https://example.com', integrations: [partytown()], server: ({command}) => ({ port: command === 'dev' ? 4321 : 1234, }), build: { client: './custom-client', }, }, { output: 'server', base: '/astro', integrations: [mdx()], server: ({command}) => ({ host: command === 'dev' ? 'localhost' : 'site.localhost', }), build: { server: './custom-server', }, } ); // Result is equivalent to: { output: 'server', site: 'https://example.com', base: '/astro', integrations: [partytown(), mdx()], server: ({command}) => ({ port: command === 'dev' ? 4321 : 1234, host: command === 'dev' ? 'localhost' : 'site.localhost', }), build: { client: './custom-client', server: './custom-server', }, } ``` ## `validateConfig()` [Section titled “validateConfig()”](#validateconfig) **Type:** `(userConfig: any, root: string, cmd: string): Promise<AstroConfig>` **Added in:** `astro@5.4.0` Imported from `astro/config`, validates an object as if it was exported from `astro.config.mjs` and imported by Astro. It takes the following arguments: * The configuration to be validated. * The root directory of the project. * The Astro command that is being executed (`build`, `dev`, `sync`, etc.) The returned promise resolves to the validated configuration, filled with all default values appropriate for the given Astro command. ```ts import { validateConfig } from "astro/config"; const config = await validateConfig({ integrations: [partytown()], }, "./my-project", "build"); // defaults are applied await rm(config.outDir, { recursive: true, force: true }); ```

# Publish to npm

> Learn how to publish Astro components to npm

Building a new Astro component? **Publish it to [npm!](https://npmjs.com/)** Publishing an Astro component is a great way to reuse your existing work across your projects, and to share with the wider Astro community at large. Astro components can be published directly to and installed from npm, just like any other JavaScript package. Looking for inspiration? Check out some of our favorite [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) and [components](https://astro.build/integrations/) from the Astro community. You can also [search npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:astro-component,withastro) to see the entire public catalog. ## Quick Start [Section titled “Quick Start”](#quick-start) To get started developing your component quickly, you can use a template already set up for you. ```bash # Initialize the Astro Component template in a new directory npm create astro@latest my-new-component-directory -- --template component # yarn yarn create astro my-new-component-directory --template component # pnpm pnpm create astro@latest my-new-component-directory -- --template component ``` ## Creating a package [Section titled “Creating a package”](#creating-a-package) To create a new package, configure your development environment to use **workspaces** within your project. This will allow you to develop your component alongside a working copy of Astro. This example, named `my-project`, creates a project with a single package, named `my-component`, and a `demo/` directory for testing and demonstrating the component. This is configured in the project root’s `package.json` file: ```json { "name": "my-project", "workspaces": ["demo", "packages/*"] } ``` In this example, multiple packages can be developed together from the `packages` directory. These packages can also be referenced from `demo`, where you can install a working copy of Astro. ```shell npm create astro@latest demo -- --template minimal # yarn yarn create astro demo --template minimal # pnpm pnpm create astro@latest demo -- --template minimal ``` There are two initial files that will make up your individual package: `package.json` and `index.js`. ### `package.json` [Section titled “package.json”](#packagejson) The `package.json` in the package directory includes all of the information related to your package, including its description, dependencies, and any other package metadata. ```json { "name": "my-component", "description": "Component description", "version": "1.0.0", "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme", "type": "module", "exports": { ".": "./index.js", "./astro": "./MyAstroComponent.astro", "./react": "./MyReactComponent.jsx" }, "files": ["index.js", "MyAstroComponent.astro", "MyReactComponent.jsx"], "keywords": ["astro", "withastro", "astro-component", "...", "..."] } ``` #### `description` [Section titled “description”](#description) A short description of your component used to help others know what it does. ```json { "description": "An Astro Element Generator" } ``` #### `type` [Section titled “type”](#type) The module format used by Node.js and Astro to interpret your `index.js` files. ```json { "type": "module" } ``` Use `"type": "module"` so that your `index.js` can be used as an entrypoint with `import` and `export` . #### `homepage` [Section titled “homepage”](#homepage) The url to the project homepage. ```json { "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme" } ``` This is a great way to direct users to an online demo, documentation, or homepage for your project. #### `exports` [Section titled “exports”](#exports) The entry points of a package when imported by name. ```json { "exports": { ".": "./index.js", "./astro": "./MyAstroComponent.astro", "./react": "./MyReactComponent.jsx" } } ``` In this example, importing `my-component` would use `index.js`, while importing `my-component/astro` or `my-component/react` would use `MyAstroComponent.astro` or `MyReactComponent.jsx` respectively. #### `files` [Section titled “files”](#files) An optional optimization to exclude unnecessary files from the bundle shipped to users via npm. Note that **only files listed here will be included in your package**, so if you add or change files necessary for your package to work, you must update this list accordingly. ```json { "files": ["index.js", "MyAstroComponent.astro", "MyReactComponent.jsx"] } ``` #### `keywords` [Section titled “keywords”](#keywords) An array of keywords relevant to your component, used to help others [find your component on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:astro-component,withastro) and in any other search catalogs. Add `astro-component`, `astro-integration`, or `withastro` as a special keyword to maximize its discoverability in the Astro ecosystem. ```json { "keywords": ["astro-component", "withastro", "... etc", "... etc"] } ``` *** ### `index.js` [Section titled “index.js”](#indexjs) The main **package entrypoint** used whenever your package is imported. ```js export { default as MyAstroComponent } from './MyAstroComponent.astro'; export { default as MyReactComponent } from './MyReactComponent.jsx'; ``` This allows you to package multiple components together into a single interface. #### Example: Using Named Imports [Section titled “Example: Using Named Imports”](#example-using-named-imports) ```astro --- import { MyAstroComponent } from 'my-component'; import { MyReactComponent } from 'my-component'; --- <MyAstroComponent /> <MyReactComponent /> ``` #### Example: Using Namespace Imports [Section titled “Example: Using Namespace Imports”](#example-using-namespace-imports) ```astro --- import * as Example from 'example-astro-component'; --- <Example.MyAstroComponent /> <Example.MyReactComponent /> ``` #### Example: Using Individual Imports [Section titled “Example: Using Individual Imports”](#example-using-individual-imports) ```astro --- import MyAstroComponent from 'example-astro-component/astro'; import MyReactComponent from 'example-astro-component/react'; --- <MyAstroComponent /> <MyReactComponent /> ``` *** ## Developing your package [Section titled “Developing your package”](#developing-your-package) Astro does not have a dedicated “package mode” for development. Instead, you should use a demo project to develop and test your package inside of your project. This can be a private website only used for development, or a public demo/documentation website for your package. If you are extracting components from an existing project, you can even continue to use that project to develop your now-extracted components. ## Testing your component [Section titled “Testing your component”](#testing-your-component) Astro does not currently ship a test runner. *(If you are interested in helping out with this, [join us on Discord!](https://astro.build/chat))* In the meantime, our current recommendation for testing is: 1. Add a test `fixtures` directory to your `demo/src/pages` directory. 2. Add a new page for every test that you’d like to run. 3. Each page should include some different component usage that you’d like to test. 4. Run `astro build` to build your fixtures, then compare the output of the `dist/__fixtures__/` directory to what you expected. ## Publishing your component [Section titled “Publishing your component”](#publishing-your-component) Once you have your package ready, you can publish it to npm using the `npm publish` command. If that fails, make sure that you have logged in via `npm login` and that your `package.json` is correct. If it succeeds, you’re done! Notice that there was no `build` step for Astro packages. Any file type that Astro supports natively, such as `.astro`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, and `.css`, can be published directly without a build step. If you need another file type that isn’t natively supported by Astro, add a build step to your package. This advanced exercise is left up to you. ## Integrations Library [Section titled “Integrations Library”](#integrations-library) Share your hard work by adding your integration to our [integrations library](https://astro.build/integrations/)! ### `package.json` data [Section titled “package.json data”](#packagejson-data) The library is automatically updated weekly, pulling in every package published to npm with the `astro-component`, `astro-integration`, or `withastro` keyword. The integrations library reads the `name`, `description`, `repository`, and `homepage` data from your `package.json`. Avatars are a great way to highlight your brand in the library! Once your package is published you can [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) with your avatar attached and we will add it to your listing. ### Categories [Section titled “Categories”](#categories) In addition to the required `astro-component`, `astro-integration`, or `withastro` keyword, special keywords are also used to automatically organize packages. Including any of the keywords below will add your integration to the matching category in our integrations library. | category | keywords | | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | | Accessibility | `a11y`, `accessibility` | | Adapters | `astro-adapter` | | Analytics | `analytics` | | CSS + UI | `css`, `ui`, `icon`, `icons`, `renderer` | | Frameworks | `renderer` | | Content Loaders | `astro-loader` | | Images + Media | `media`, `image`, `images`, `video`, `audio` | | Performance + SEO | `performance`, `perf`, `seo`, `optimization` | | Dev Toolbar | `devtools`, `dev-overlay`, `dev-toolbar` | | Utilities | `tooling`, `utils`, `utility` | Packages that don’t include any keyword matching a category will be shown as `Uncategorized`. ## Share [Section titled “Share”](#share) We encourage you to share your work, and we really do love seeing what our talented Astronauts create. Come and share what you create with us in our [Discord](https://astro.build/chat) or mention [@astrodotbuild](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild) in a Tweet!

# Routing Reference

There is no separate routing configuration in Astro. Every [supported page file](/en/basics/astro-pages/#supported-page-files) located within the special `src/pages/` directory creates a route. When the file name contains a [parameter](#params), a route can create multiple pages dynamically, otherwise it creates a single page. By default, all Astro page routes and endpoints are generated and prerendered at build time. [On-demand server rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) can be set for individual routes, or as the default. ## `prerender` [Section titled “prerender”](#prerender) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `true` in static mode (default); `false` with `output: 'server'` configuration **Added in:** `astro@1.0.0` A value exported from each individual route to determine whether or not it is prerendered. By default, all pages and endpoints are prerendered and will be statically generated at build time. You can opt out of prerendering on one or more routes, and you can have both static and on-demand rendered routes in the same project. ### Per-page override [Section titled “Per-page override”](#per-page-override) You can override the default value to enable [on demand rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) for an individual route by exporting `prerender` with the value `false` from that file: src/pages/rendered-on-demand.astro ```astro --- export const prerender = false --- <!-- server-rendered content --> <!-- the rest of my site is static --> ``` ### Switch to `server` mode [Section titled “Switch to server mode”](#switch-to-server-mode) You can override the default value for all routes by configuring [`output: 'server'`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#output). In this output mode, all pages and endpoints will be generated on the server upon request by default instead of being prerendered. In `server` mode, enable prerendering for an individual route by exporting `prerender` with the value `true` from that file: src/pages/static-about-page.astro ```astro --- // with `output: 'server'` configured export const prerender = true --- <!-- My static about page --> <!-- All other pages are rendered on demand --> ``` ## `partial` [Section titled “partial”](#partial) **Type:** `boolean`\ **Default:** `false` **Added in:** `astro@3.4.0` A value exported from an individual route to determine whether or not it should be rendered as a full HTML page. By default, all files located within the reserved `src/pages/` directory automatically include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and additional `<head>` content such as Astro’s scoped styles and scripts. You can override the default value to designate the content as a [page partial](/en/basics/astro-pages/#page-partials) for an individual route by exporting a value for `partial` from that file: src/pages/my-page-partial.astro ```astro --- export const partial = true --- <!-- Generated HTML available at a URL --> <!-- Available to a rendering library --> ``` The `export const partial` must be identifiable statically. It can have the value of: * The boolean **`true`**. * An environment variable using import.meta.env such as `import.meta.env.USE_PARTIALS`. ## `getStaticPaths()` [Section titled “getStaticPaths()”](#getstaticpaths) **Type:** `(options: GetStaticPathsOptions) => Promise<GetStaticPathsResult> | GetStaticPathsResult` **Added in:** `astro@1.0.0` A function to generate multiple, prerendered page routes from a single `.astro` page component with one or more [parameters](#params) in its file path. Use this for routes that will be created at build time, also known as static site building. The `getStaticPaths()` function must return an array of objects to determine which URL paths will be prerendered by Astro. Each object must include a `params` object, to specify route paths. The object may optionally contain a `props` object with [data to be passed](#data-passing-with-props) to each page template. src/pages/blog/\[post].astro ```astro --- // In 'server' mode, opt in to prerendering: // export const prerender = true export async function getStaticPaths() { return [ // { params: { /* required */ }, props: { /* optional */ } }, { params: { post: '1' } }, // [post] is the parameter { params: { post: '2' } }, // must match the file name // ... ]; } --- <!-- Your HTML template here. --> ``` `getStaticPaths()` can also be used in static file endpoints for [dynamic routing](/en/guides/endpoints/#params-and-dynamic-routing). Caution The `getStaticPaths()` function executes in its own isolated scope once, before any page loads. Therefore you can’t reference anything from its parent scope, other than file imports. The compiler will warn you if you break this requirement. ### `params` [Section titled “params”](#params) The `params` key of each object in the array returned by `getStaticPaths()` tells Astro what routes to build. The keys in `params` must match the parameters defined in your component file path. The value for each `params` object must match the parameters used in the page name. `params` are encoded into the URL, so only strings are supported as values. For example,`src/pages/posts/[id].astro`has an `id` parameter in its file name. The following `getStaticPaths()` function in this `.astro` component tells Astro to statically generate `posts/1`, `posts/2`, and `posts/3` at build time. src/pages/posts/\[id].astro ```astro --- export async function getStaticPaths() { return [ { params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }, { params: { id: '3' } } ]; } const { id } = Astro.params; --- <h1>{id}</h1> ``` ### Data passing with `props` [Section titled “Data passing with props”](#data-passing-with-props) To pass additional data to each generated page, you can set a `props` value on each object in the array returned by `getStaticPaths()`. Unlike `params`, `props` are not encoded into the URL and so aren’t limited to only strings. For example, if you generate pages with data fetched from a remote API, you can pass the full data object to the page component inside of `getStaticPaths()`. The page template can reference the data from each post using `Astro.props`. src/pages/posts/\[id].astro ```astro --- export async function getStaticPaths() { const response = await fetch('...'); const data = await response.json(); return data.map((post) => { return { params: { id: post.id }, props: { post }, }; }); } const { id } = Astro.params; const { post } = Astro.props; --- <h1>{id}: {post.name}</h1> ``` ### `routePattern` [Section titled “routePattern”](#routepattern) **Type:** `string` **Added in:** `astro@5.14.0` A property available in [`getStaticPaths()`](#getstaticpaths) options to access the current [`routePattern`](/en/reference/api-reference/#routepattern) as a string. This provides data from the [Astro render context](/en/reference/api-reference/) that would not otherwise be available within the scope of `getStaticPaths()` and can be useful to calculate the `params` and `props` for each page route. `routePattern` always reflects the original dynamic segment definition in the file path (e.g. `/[...locale]/[files]/[slug]`), unlike `params`, which are explicit values for a page (e.g. `/fr/fichiers/article-1/`). The following example shows how to localize your route segments and return an array of static paths by passing `routePattern` to a custom `getLocalizedData()` helper function. The [params](/en/reference/routing-reference/#params) object will be set with explicit values for each route segment: `locale`, `files`, and `slug`. Then, these values will be used to generate the routes and can be used in your page template via `Astro.params`. src/pages/\[...locale]/\[files]/\[slug].astro ```astro --- import { getLocalizedData } from "../../../utils/i18n"; export async function getStaticPaths({ routePattern }) { const response = await fetch('...'); const data = await response.json(); console.log(routePattern); // [...locale]/[files]/[slug] // Call your custom helper with `routePattern` to generate the static paths return data.flatMap((file) => getLocalizedData(file, routePattern)); } const { locale, files, slug } = Astro.params; --- ``` ### `paginate()` [Section titled “paginate()”](#paginate) **Added in:** `astro@1.0.0` A function that can be returned from [`getStaticPaths()`](#getstaticpaths) to divide a collection of content items into separate pages. `paginate()` will automatically generate the necessary array to return from `getStaticPaths()` to create one URL for every page of your paginated collection. The page number will be passed as a `param`, and the page data will be passed as a `page` prop. The following example fetches and passes 150 items to the `paginate` function, and creates static, prerendered pages at build time that will display 10 items per page: src/pages/pokemon/\[page].astro ```astro --- export async function getStaticPaths({ paginate }) { // Load your data with fetch(), getCollection(), etc. const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=150`); const result = await response.json(); const allPokemon = result.results; // Return a paginated collection of paths for all items return paginate(allPokemon, { pageSize: 10 }); } const { page } = Astro.props; --- ``` `paginate()` has the following arguments: * `data` - array containing the page’s data passed to the `paginate()` function * `options` - Optional object with the following properties: * `pageSize` - The number of items shown per page (`10` by default) * `params` - Send additional parameters for creating dynamic routes * `props` - Send additional props to be available on each page `paginate()` assumes a file name of `[page].astro` or `[...page].astro`. The `page` param becomes the page number in your URL: * `/posts/[page].astro` would generate the URLs `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, `/posts/3`, etc. * `/posts/[...page].astro` would generate the URLs `/posts`, `/posts/2`, `/posts/3`, etc. #### The pagination `page` prop [Section titled “The pagination page prop”](#the-pagination-page-prop) **Type:** `Page<TData>` Pagination will pass a `page` prop to every rendered page that represents a single page of data in the paginated collection. This includes the data that you’ve paginated (`page.data`) as well as metadata for the page (`page.url`, `page.start`, `page.end`, `page.total`, etc). This metadata is useful for things like a “Next Page” button or a “Showing 1-10 of 100” message. ##### `page.data` [Section titled “page.data”](#pagedata) **Type:** `Array<TData>` Array of data returned from the `paginate()` function for the current page. ##### `page.start` [Section titled “page.start”](#pagestart) **Type:** `number` Index of the first item on the current page, starting at `0`. (e.g. if `pageSize: 25`, this would be `0` on page 1, `25` on page 2, etc.) ##### `page.end` [Section titled “page.end”](#pageend) **Type:** `number` Index of the last item on the current page. ##### `page.size` [Section titled “page.size”](#pagesize) **Type:** `number`\ **Default:** `10` The total number of items per page. ##### `page.total` [Section titled “page.total”](#pagetotal) **Type:** `number` The total number of items across all pages. ##### `page.currentPage` [Section titled “page.currentPage”](#pagecurrentpage) **Type:** `number` The current page number, starting with `1`. ##### `page.lastPage` [Section titled “page.lastPage”](#pagelastpage) **Type:** `number` The total number of pages. ##### `page.url.current` [Section titled “page.url.current”](#pageurlcurrent) **Type:** `string` Get the URL of the current page (useful for canonical URLs). If a value is set for [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), the URL starts with that value. ##### `page.url.prev` [Section titled “page.url.prev”](#pageurlprev) **Type:** `string | undefined` Get the URL of the previous page (will be `undefined` if on page 1). If a value is set for [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), prepend the base path to the URL. ##### `page.url.next` [Section titled “page.url.next”](#pageurlnext) **Type:** `string | undefined` Get the URL of the next page (will be `undefined` if no more pages). If a value is set for [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), prepend the base path to the URL. ##### `page.url.first` [Section titled “page.url.first”](#pageurlfirst) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@4.12.0` Get the URL of the first page (will be `undefined` if on page 1). If a value is set for [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), prepend the base path to the URL. ##### `page.url.last` [Section titled “page.url.last”](#pageurllast) **Type:** `string | undefined` **Added in:** `astro@4.12.0` Get the URL of the last page (will be `undefined` if no more pages). If a value is set for [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), prepend the base path to the URL.
