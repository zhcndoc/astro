These host platforms automatically detect pushes to your Astro project’s source repository, build your site and deploy it to the web at a custom URL or your personal domain. Often, setting up a deployment on these platforms will follow steps something like the following: 1. Add your repository to an online Git provider (e.g. in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) 2. Choose a host that supports **continuous deployment** (e.g. [Netlify](/en/guides/deploy/netlify/) or [Vercel](/en/guides/deploy/vercel/)) and import your Git repository as a new site/project. Many common hosts will recognize your project as an Astro site, and should choose the appropriate configuration settings to build and deploy your site as shown below. (If not, these settings can be changed.) 3. Click “Deploy” and your new website will be created at a unique URL for that host (e.g. `new-astro-site.netlify.app`). The host will be automatically configured to watch your Git provider’s main branch for changes, and to rebuild and republish your site at each new commit. These settings can typically be configured in your host provider’s dashboard UI. ### CLI Deployment [Section titled “CLI Deployment”](#cli-deployment) Some hosts will have their own command line interface (CLI) you can install globally to your machine using npm. Often, using a CLI to deploy looks something like the following: 1. Install your host’s CLI globally, for example: * npm ```shell npm install --global netlify-cli ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add --global netlify-cli ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn global add netlify-cli ``` 2. Run the CLI and follow any instructions for authorization, setup etc. 3. Build your site and deploy to your host Many common hosts will build and deploy your site for you. They will usually recognize your project as an Astro site, and should choose the appropriate configuration settings to build and deploy as shown below. (If not, these settings can be changed.) Other hosts will require you to [build your site locally](#building-your-site-locally) and deploy using the command line. ## Building Your Site Locally [Section titled “Building Your Site Locally”](#building-your-site-locally) Many hosts like Netlify and Vercel will build your site for you and then publish that build output to the web. But, some sites will require you to build locally and then run a deploy command or upload your build output. You may also wish to build locally to preview your site, or to catch any potential errors and warnings in your own environment. Run the command `npm run build` to build your Astro site. * npm ```shell npm run build ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm run build ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn run build ``` By default, the build output will be placed at `dist/`. This location can be changed using the [`outDir` configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#outdir). ## Adding an Adapter for on-demand rendering [Section titled “Adding an Adapter for on-demand rendering”](#adding-an-adapter-for-on-demand-rendering)

# Deploy your Astro Site to AWS

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using AWS.

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is a full-featured web app hosting platform that can be used to deploy an Astro site. Deploying your project to AWS requires using the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). (Most of these actions can also be done using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)). This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your site to AWS using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [S3 static website hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). ## AWS Amplify [Section titled “AWS Amplify”](#aws-amplify) AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that lets frontend web and mobile developers quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS. You can either deploy your Astro project as a static site, or as a server-rendered site. ### Static Site [Section titled “Static Site”](#static-site) Your Astro project is a static site by default. 1. Create a new Amplify Hosting project. 2. Connect your repository to Amplify. 3. Modify your build settings to match your project’s build process. * npm ```yaml version: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - npm ci build: commands: - npm run build artifacts: baseDirectory: /dist files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - node_modules/**/* ``` * pnpm ```yaml version: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - npm i -g pnpm - pnpm config set store-dir .pnpm-store - pnpm i build: commands: - pnpm run build artifacts: baseDirectory: /dist files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - .pnpm-store/**/* ``` * Yarn ```yaml version: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - yarn install build: commands: - yarn build artifacts: baseDirectory: /dist files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - node_modules/**/* ``` Amplify will automatically deploy your website and update it when you push a commit to your repository. ### Adapter for on-demand rendering [Section titled “Adapter for on-demand rendering”](#adapter-for-on-demand-rendering) In order to deploy your project as a server-rendered site, you will need to use the third-party, [community-maintained AWS Amplify adapter](https://github.com/alexnguyennz/astro-aws-amplify) and make some changes to your config. First, install the Amplify adapter. * npm ```shell npm install astro-aws-amplify ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm add astro-aws-amplify ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add astro-aws-amplify ``` Then, in your `astro.config.*` file, add the adapter and set the output to `server`. astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; +import awsAmplify from 'astro-aws-amplify'; export default defineConfig({ // ... + output: "server", + adapter: awsAmplify(), }); ``` Once the adapter has been installed, you can set up your Amplify project. 1. Create a new Amplify Hosting project. 2. Connect your repository to Amplify. 3. Modify your build settings to match the adapter’s build process by either editing the build settings in the AWS console, or by adding an `amplify.yaml` in the root of your project. * npm ```yaml version: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline build: commands: - npm run build - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default artifacts: baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - .npm/**/* ``` * pnpm ```yaml version: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - npm i -g pnpm - pnpm config set store-dir .pnpm-store - pnpm i build: commands: - pnpm run build - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default artifacts: baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - .pnpm-store/**/* ``` * Yarn ```yaml version: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - yarn install build: commands: - yarn build - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default artifacts: baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - node_modules/**/* ``` Amplify will automatically deploy your website and update it when you push a commit to your repository. See [AWS’s Astro deployment guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/get-started-astro.html) for more info. ## S3 static website hosting [Section titled “S3 static website hosting”](#s3-static-website-hosting) S3 is the starting point of any application. It is where your project files and other assets are stored. S3 charges for file storage and number of requests. You can find more information about S3 in the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). 1. Create an S3 bucket with your project’s name. 2. Disable **“Block all public access”**. By default, AWS sets all buckets to be private. To make it public, you need to uncheck the “Block public access” checkbox in the bucket’s properties. 3. Upload your built files located in `dist` to S3. You can do this manually in the console or use the AWS CLI. If you use the AWS CLI, use the following command after [authenticating with your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html): ```plaintext aws s3 cp dist/ s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/ --recursive ``` 4. Update your bucket policy to allow public access. You can find this setting in the bucket’s **Permissions > Bucket policy**. ```json { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": "*", "Action": "s3:GetObject", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*" } ] } ``` Caution Do not forget to replace `<BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of your bucket. 5. Enable website hosting for your bucket. You can find this setting in the bucket’s **Properties > Static website hosting**. Set your index document to `index.html` and your error document to `404.html`. Finally, you can find your new website URL in the bucket’s **Properties > Static website hosting**. ## S3 with CloudFront [Section titled “S3 with CloudFront”](#s3-with-cloudfront) CloudFront is a web service that provides content delivery network (CDN) capabilities. It is used to cache content of a web server and distribute it to end users. CloudFront charges for the amount of data transferred. Adding CloudFront to your S3 bucket is more cost-effective and provides a faster delivery. To connect S3 with CloudFront, create a CloudFront distribution with the following values: * **Origin domain:** Your S3 bucket static website endpoint. You can find your endpoint in your S3 bucket’s **Properties > Static website hosting**. Alternative, you can select your s3 bucket and click on the callout to replace your bucket address with your bucket static endpoint. * **Viewer protocol policy:** “Redirect to HTTPS” This configuration will serve your site using the CloudFront CDN network. You can find your CloudFront distribution URL in the bucket’s **Distributions > Domain name**. ## Continuous deployment with GitHub Actions [Section titled “Continuous deployment with GitHub Actions”](#continuous-deployment-with-github-actions) There are many ways to set up continuous deployment for AWS. One possibility for code hosted on GitHub is to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy your website every time you push a commit. 1. Create a new policy in your AWS account using [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) with the following permissions. This policy will allow you to upload built files to your S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront distribution files when you push a commit. ```json { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "VisualEditor0", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:DeleteObject", "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation" ], "Resource": [ "<DISTRIBUTION_ARN>", "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*", "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>" ] } ] } ``` Caution Do not forget to replace `<DISTRIBUTION_ARN>` and `<BUCKET_NAME>`. You can find the DISTRIBUTION\_ARN in **CloudFront > Distributions > Details**. 2. Create a new IAM user and attach the policy to the user. This will provide your `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`. 3. Add this sample workflow to your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and push it to GitHub. You will need to add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `BUCKET_ID`, and `DISTRIBUTION_ID` as “secrets” to your repository on GitHub under **Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions**. Click `New repository secret` to add each one. ```yaml name: Deploy Website on: push: branches: - main jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Configure AWS Credentials uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1 with: aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }} aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }} aws-region: us-east-1 - name: Install modules run: npm ci - name: Build application run: npm run build - name: Deploy to S3 run: aws s3 sync --delete ./dist/ s3://${{ secrets.BUCKET_ID }} - name: Create CloudFront invalidation run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.DISTRIBUTION_ID }} --paths "/*" ``` ## Community Resources [Section titled “Community Resources”](#community-resources) * [Deploy Astro to AWS Amplify](https://www.launchfa.st/blog/deploy-astro-aws-amplify) * [Deploy Astro to AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.launchfa.st/blog/deploy-astro-aws-elastic-beanstalk) * [Deploy Astro to Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate](https://www.launchfa.st/blog/deploy-astro-aws-fargate) * [Troubleshooting SSR Amplify Deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-ssr-deployment.html)

Create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). Running `astro add cloudflare` will create this for you; if you are not using the adapter, you’ll need to create it yourself. * Static wrangler.jsonc ```jsonc { "name": "my-astro-app", "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy "assets": { "directory": "./dist", } } ``` * On demand wrangler.jsonc ```jsonc { "main": "dist/_worker.js/index.js", "name": "my-astro-app", "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy "compatibility_flags": [ "nodejs_compat", "global_fetch_strictly_public" ], "assets": { "binding": "ASSETS", "directory": "./dist" }, "observability": { "enabled": true } } ``` 4. Preview your project locally with Wrangler. ```bash npx astro build && npx wrangler dev ``` 5. Deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`. ```bash npx astro build && npx wrangler deploy ``` After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site. Read more about using [Cloudflare runtime APIs](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) such as bindings. ### How to deploy with CI/CD [Section titled “How to deploy with CI/CD”](#how-to-deploy-with-cicd) You can also use a CI/CD system such as [Workers Builds (BETA)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) to automatically build and deploy your site on push. If you’re using Workers Builds: 1. Follow Steps 1-3 from the Wrangler section above. 2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to `Workers & Pages`. Select `Create`. 3. Under `Import a repository`, select a Git account and then the repository containing your Astro project. 4. Configure your project with: * Build command: `npx astro build` * Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy` 5. Click `Save and Deploy`. You can now preview your Worker at its provided `workers.dev` subdomain. ## Cloudflare Pages [Section titled “Cloudflare Pages”](#cloudflare-pages) ### How to deploy with Wrangler [Section titled “How to deploy with Wrangler”](#how-to-deploy-with-wrangler-1) 1. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/). * npm ```sh npm install wrangler@latest --save-dev ``` * pnpm ```sh pnpm add wrangler@latest --save-dev ``` * Yarn ```sh yarn add wrangler@latest --dev ``` 2. If your site uses on-demand rendering, install the [`@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/). This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step. * npm ```sh npx astro add cloudflare ``` * pnpm ```sh pnpm astro add cloudflare ``` * Yarn ```sh yarn astro add cloudflare ``` 3. Create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). Because Cloudflare recommends new projects use Workers instead of Pages, the `astro add cloudflare` command creates a `wrangler.jsonc` and `public/.assetsignore` file, which are specific to Workers projects. You will need to delete the `public/.assetsignore` file and change your `wrangler.jsonc` file. If you are not using the adapter you’ll need to create it yourself. Ensure your `wrangler.jsonc` file is structured like this: * Static wrangler.jsonc ```jsonc { "name": "my-astro-app", "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy "pages_build_output_dir": "./dist" } ``` * On demand wrangler.jsonc ```jsonc { "name": "my-astro-app", "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy "compatibility_flags": [ "nodejs_compat", "disable_nodejs_process_v2" ], "pages_build_output_dir": "./dist" } ``` Read more about [on-demand rendering in Astro](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/). 4. Preview your project locally with Wrangler. * npm ```sh npx astro build && wrangler pages dev ./dist ``` * pnpm ```sh pnpm astro build && wrangler pages dev ./dist ``` * Yarn ```sh yarn astro build && wrangler pages dev ./dist ``` 5. Deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`. * npm ```sh npx astro build && wrangler pages deploy ./dist ``` * pnpm ```sh pnpm astro build && wrangler pages deploy ./dist ``` * Yarn ```sh yarn astro build && wrangler pages deploy ./dist ``` After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site. ### How to deploy a site with CI/CD [Section titled “How to deploy a site with CI/CD”](#how-to-deploy-a-site-with-cicd) 1. Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab). 2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Compute (Workers) > Workers & Pages**. Select **Create** and then select the **Pages** tab. Connect your git repository. 3. Configure your project with: * **Framework preset**: `Astro` * **Build command:** `npm run build` * **Build output directory:** `dist` 4. Click the **Save and Deploy** button. ## Troubleshooting [Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting) ### 404 behavior [Section titled “404 behavior”](#404-behavior) For Workers projects, you will need to set `not_found_handling` if you want to serve a custom 404 page. You can read more about this in the [Routing behavior section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/#routing-behavior) of Cloudflare’s documentation. wrangler.jsonc ```jsonc { "assets": { "directory": "./dist", "not_found_handling": "404-page" } } ``` For Pages projects, if you include a custom 404 page, it will be served by default. Otherwise, Pages will default to [Cloudflare’s single-page application rendering behavior](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/#single-page-application-spa-rendering) and redirect to the home page instead of showing a 404 page. ### Client-side hydration [Section titled “Client-side hydration”](#client-side-hydration) Client-side hydration may fail as a result of Cloudflare’s Auto Minify setting. If you see `Hydration completed but contains mismatches` in the console, make sure to disable Auto Minify under Cloudflare settings. ### Node.js runtime APIs [Section titled “Node.js runtime APIs”](#nodejs-runtime-apis) If you are building a project that is using on-demand rendering with [the Cloudflare adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) and the server fails to build with an error message such as `[Error] Could not resolve "XXXX. The package "XXXX" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.`: * This means that a package or import you are using in the server-side environment is not compatible with the [Cloudflare runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/). * If you are directly importing a Node.js runtime API, please refer to the Astro documentation on Cloudflare’s [Node.js compatibility](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#nodejs-compatibility) for further steps on how to resolve this. * If you are importing a package that imports a Node.js runtime API, check with the author of the package to see if they support the `node:*` import syntax. If they do not, you may need to find an alternative package.

You can deploy a static or on-demand rendered Astro site using Deno, either on your own server, or to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), a distributed system that runs JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, worldwide. This guide includes instructions for running your Astro site on your own server with Deno, and deploying to Deno Deploy through GitHub Actions or the Deno Deploy CLI. ## Requirements [Section titled “Requirements”](#requirements) This guide assumes you already have [Deno](https://deno.com/) installed. ## Project Configuration [Section titled “Project Configuration”](#project-configuration) Your Astro project can be deployed as a static site, or as an on-demand rendered site. ### Static Site [Section titled “Static Site”](#static-site) Your Astro project is a static site by default. You don’t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site with Deno, or to Deno Deploy. ### Adapter for on-demand rendering [Section titled “Adapter for on-demand rendering”](#adapter-for-on-demand-rendering) To enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project using Deno, and to deploy on Deno Deploy: 1. Install [the `@deno/astro-adapter` adapter](https://github.com/denoland/deno-astro-adapter) to your project’s dependencies using your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm install @deno/astro-adapter ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm install @deno/astro-adapter ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn add @deno/astro-adapter ``` 2. Update your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file with the changes below. astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; +import deno from '@deno/astro-adapter'; export default defineConfig({ + output: 'server', + adapter: deno(), }); ``` 3. Update your `preview` script in `package.json` with the change below. package.json ```diff { // ... "scripts": { "dev": "astro dev", "start": "astro dev", "build": "astro build", -"preview": "astro preview" +"preview": "deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env ./dist/server/entry.mjs" } } ``` You can now use this command to preview your production Astro site locally with Deno. * npm ```shell npm run preview ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm run preview ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn run preview ``` ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) You can run your Astro site on your own server, or deploy to Deno Deploy through GitHub Actions or using Deno Deploy’s CLI (command line interface). ### On your own server [Section titled “On your own server”](#on-your-own-server) 1. Copy your project onto your server. 2. Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm install ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm install ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn ``` 3. Build your Astro site with your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm run build ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm run build ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn run build ``` 4. Start your application with the following command: * Static ```bash deno run -A jsr:@std/http/file-server dist ``` * On demand ```bash deno run -A ./dist/server/entry.mjs ``` ### GitHub Actions Deployment [Section titled “GitHub Actions Deployment”](#github-actions-deployment) If your project is stored on GitHub, the [Deno Deploy website](https://dash.deno.com/) will guide you through setting up GitHub Actions to deploy your Astro site. 1. Push your code to a public or private GitHub repository. 2. Sign in on [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com/) with your GitHub account, and click on [New Project](https://dash.deno.com). 3. Select your repository, the branch you want to deploy from, and select **GitHub Action** mode. (Your Astro site requires a build step, and cannot use Automatic mode.) 4. In your Astro project, create a new file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and paste in the YAML below. This is similar to the YAML given by Deno Deploy, with the additional steps needed for your Astro site. * Static .github/workflows/deploy.yml ```yaml name: Deploy on: [push] jobs: deploy: name: Deploy runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: id-token: write # Needed for auth with Deno Deploy contents: read # Needed to clone the repository steps: - name: Clone repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Not using npm? Change `npm ci` to `yarn install` or `pnpm i` - name: Install dependencies run: npm ci # Not using npm? Change `npm run build` to `yarn build` or `pnpm run build` - name: Build Astro run: npm run build - name: Upload to Deno Deploy uses: denoland/deployctl@v1 with: project: my-deno-project # TODO: replace with Deno Deploy project name entrypoint: jsr:@std/http/file-server root: dist ``` * On demand .github/workflows/deploy.yml ```yaml name: Deploy on: [push] jobs: deploy: name: Deploy runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: id-token: write # Needed for auth with Deno Deploy contents: read # Needed to clone the repository steps: - name: Clone repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Not using npm? Change `npm ci` to `yarn install` or `pnpm i` - name: Install dependencies run: npm ci # Not using npm? Change `npm run build` to `yarn build` or `pnpm run build` - name: Build Astro run: npm run build - name: Upload to Deno Deploy uses: denoland/deployctl@v1 with: project: my-deno-project # TODO: replace with Deno Deploy project name entrypoint: dist/server/entry.mjs ``` 5. After committing this YAML file, and pushing to GitHub on your configured deploy branch, the deploy should begin automatically! You can track the progress using the “Actions” tab on your GitHub repository page, or on [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com). ### CLI Deployment [Section titled “CLI Deployment”](#cli-deployment) 1. Install the [Deno Deploy CLI](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/deployctl). ```bash deno install -gArf jsr:@deno/deployctl ``` 2. Build your Astro site with your preferred package manager: * npm ```shell npm run build ``` * pnpm ```shell pnpm run build ``` * Yarn ```shell yarn run build ``` 3. Run `deployctl` to deploy! * Static ```bash cd dist && deployctl deploy jsr:@std/http/file-server ``` * On demand ```bash deployctl deploy ./dist/server/entry.mjs ``` You can track all your deploys on [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com). 4. (Optional) To simplify the build and deploy into one command, add a `deploy-deno` script in `package.json`. * Static package.json ```diff { // ... "scripts": { "dev": "astro dev", "start": "astro dev", "build": "astro build", "preview": "astro preview", +"deno-deploy": "npm run build && cd dist && deployctl deploy jsr:@std/http/file-server" } } ``` * On demand package.json ```diff { // ... "scripts": { "dev": "astro dev", "start": "astro dev", "build": "astro build", "preview": "deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env ./dist/server/entry.mjs", +"deno-deploy": "npm run build && deployctl deploy ./dist/server/entry.mjs" } } ``` Then you can use this command to build and deploy your Astro site in one step. ```bash npm run deno-deploy ```

# Deploy your Astro Site to Fly.io

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using Fly.io.

You can deploy your Astro project to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your users. ## Project Configuration [Section titled “Project Configuration”](#project-configuration) Your Astro project can be deployed to Fly.io as a static site, or as a server-side rendered site (SSR). ### Static Site [Section titled “Static Site”](#static-site) Your Astro project is a static site by default. You don’t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Fly.io. ### Adapter for SSR [Section titled “Adapter for SSR”](#adapter-for-ssr) To enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project and deploy on Fly.io, add [the Node.js adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/). ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) 1. [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/#first-time-or-no-fly-account-sign-up-for-fly) if you haven’t already. 2. [Install `flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/), your Fly.io app command center. 3. Run the following command in your terminal. ```bash fly launch ``` `flyctl` will automatically detect Astro, configure the correct settings, build your image, and deploy it to the Fly.io platform. ## Generating your Astro Dockerfile [Section titled “Generating your Astro Dockerfile”](#generating-your-astro-dockerfile) If you don’t already have a Dockerfile, `fly launch` will generate one for you, as well as prepare a `fly.toml` file. For pages rendered on demand, this Dockerfile will include the appropriate start command and environment variables. You can instead create your own Dockerfile using [Dockerfile generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flydotio/dockerfile) and then run using the command `npx dockerfile` for Node applications or `bunx dockerfile` for Bun applications. ## Official Resources [Section titled “Official Resources”](#official-resources) * Check out [the official Fly.io docs](https://fly.io/docs/js/frameworks/astro/)

# Deploy your Astro Site to GitHub Pages

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using GitHub Pages.

You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host a static, prerendered Astro website directly from a repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) Astro maintains an [official Astro GitHub Action to deploy your project to a GitHub Pages](https://github.com/withastro/action) with very little configuration and is the recommended way to deploy to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below to use the GitHub Action to deploy your Astro site to GitHub Pages. This will create a website from your repository at a GitHub URL (e.g. `https://<username>.github.io/<my-repo>`). Once deployed, you can optionally [configure a custom domain](#change-your-github-url-to-a-custom-domain) to deploy your GitHub Pages site at your preferred domain (e.g. `https://example.com`). 1. Create a new file in your project at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and paste in the YAML below. deploy.yml ```yaml name: Deploy to GitHub Pages on: # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name push: branches: [ main ] # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub. workflow_dispatch: # Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout your repository using git uses: actions/checkout@v5 - name: Install, build, and upload your site uses: withastro/action@v5 # with: # path: . # The root location of your Astro project inside the repository. (optional) # node-version: 24 # The specific version of Node that should be used to build your site. Defaults to 22. (optional) # package-manager: pnpm@latest # The Node package manager that should be used to install dependencies and build your site. Automatically detected based on your lockfile. (optional) # build-cmd: pnpm run build # The command to run to build your site. Runs the package build script/task by default. (optional) # env: # PUBLIC_POKEAPI: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2' # Use single quotation marks for the variable value. (optional) deploy: needs: build runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: github-pages url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} steps: - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4 ``` The Astro action can be configured with optional inputs. Provide these by uncommenting the `with:` line and the input you want to use. If your site requires any public environment variables, uncomment the `env:` line and add them there. (See the [GitHub documentation on setting secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository) for adding private environment variables.) Caution The official Astro [action](https://github.com/withastro/action) scans for a lockfile to detect your preferred package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`). You should commit your package manager’s automatically generated `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb` file to your repository. 2. In your Astro config file, set [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) to the GitHub URL of your deployed site. astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config' export default defineConfig({ + site: 'https://astronaut.github.io', }) ``` The value for `site` must be one of the following: * The following URL based on your username: `https://<username>.github.io` * The random URL autogenerated for a [GitHub Organization’s private page](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site): `https://<random-string>.pages.github.io/` 3. In `astro.config.mjs`, configure a value for [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) (usually required). GitHub Pages will publish your website at an address that depends on both your username and your repository name (e.g. `https://<username>/github.io/<my-repo>/`). Set a value for `base` that specifies the repository for your website. This is so that Astro understands your website’s root is `/my-repo`, rather than the default `/`. You can skip this if your repository name matches the special `<username>.github.io` pattern (e.g. `https://github.com/username/username.github.io/`) Configure `base` as the repository’s name starting with a forward slash ( e.g. `/my-repo`): astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config' export default defineConfig({ + site: 'https://astronaut.github.io', + base: '/my-repo', }) ``` Internal links with `base` configured When this value is configured, all of your internal page links must be prefixed with your `base` value: ```astro <a href="/my-repo/about">About</a> ``` See more about [configuring a `base` value](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base). 4. On GitHub, go to your repository’s **Settings** tab and find the **Pages** section of the settings. 5. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the **Source** of your site. When you push changes to your Astro project’s repository, the GitHub Action will automatically deploy them for you at your GitHub URL. ## Change your GitHub URL to a custom domain [Section titled “Change your GitHub URL to a custom domain”](#change-your-github-url-to-a-custom-domain) Once your Astro project is [deployed to GitHub pages at a GitHub URL](#how-to-deploy) following the previous instructions, you can configure a custom domain. This means that users can visit your site at your custom domain `https://example.com` instead of `https://<username>.github.io`. 1. [Configure DNS for your domain provider](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain). 2. Add a `./public/CNAME` record to your project. Create the following file in your `public/` folder with a single line of text that specifies your custom domain: public/CNAME ```js sub.example.com ``` This will deploy your site at your custom domain instead of `user.github.io`. 3. In your Astro config, update the value for `site` with your custom domain. Do not set a value for `base`, and remove one if it exists: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config' export default defineConfig({ + site: 'https://example.com', - base: '/my-repo' }) ``` 4. If necessary, update all your page internal links to remove the `base` prefix: ```astro <a href="/my-repo/about">About</a> ``` ## Examples [Section titled “Examples”](#examples) * [Github Pages Deployment starter template](https://github.com/hkbertoson/github-pages) * [Starlight Flexoki Theme (production site)](https://delucis.github.io/starlight-theme-flexoki/) * [Expressive Code Color Chips (production site)](https://delucis.github.io/expressive-code-color-chips/) * [Starlight Markdown Blocks (production site)](https://delucis.github.io/starlight-markdown-blocks/)

# Deploy your Astro Site to GitLab Pages

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using GitLab Pages.

You can use [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) to host an Astro site for your [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) projects, groups, or user account. ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) You can deploy an Astro site to GitLab Pages by using GitLab CI/CD to automatically build and deploy your site. To do this, your source code must be hosted on GitLab and you need to make the following changes to your Astro project: 1. Set up [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) and [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) options in `astro.config.mjs`. astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ + site: 'https://<username>.gitlab.io', + base: '/<my-repo>', outDir: 'public', publicDir: 'static', }); ``` `site` The value for `site` must be one of the following: * The following URL based on your username: `https://<username>.gitlab.io` * The following URL based on your group name: `https://<groupname>.gitlab.io` * Your custom domain if you have it configured in your GitLab project’s settings: `https://example.com` For GitLab self-managed instances, replace `gitlab.io` with your instance’s Pages domain. `base` A value for `base` may be required so that Astro will treat your repository name (e.g. `/my-repo`) as the root of your website. The value for `base` should be your repository’s name starting with a forward slash, for example `/my-blog`. This is so that Astro understands your website’s root is `/my-repo`, rather than the default `/`. Caution When this value is configured, all of your internal page links must be prefixed with your `base` value: ```astro <a href="/my-repo/about">About</a> ``` See more about [configuring a `base` value](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) 2. Rename the `public/` directory to `static/`. 3. Set `outDir: 'public'` in `astro.config.mjs`. This setting instructs Astro to put the static build output in a folder called `public`, which is the folder required by GitLab Pages for exposed files. If you were using the [`public/` directory](/en/basics/project-structure/#public) as a source of static files in your Astro project, rename it and use that new folder name in `astro.config.mjs` for the value of `publicDir`. For example, here are the correct `astro.config.mjs` settings when the `public/` directory is renamed to `static/`: astro.config.mjs ```diff import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; export default defineConfig({ + outDir: 'public', + publicDir: 'static', }); ``` 4. Change the build output in `.gitignore`. In our example we need to change `dist/` to `public/`: .gitignore ```diff # build output dist/ public/ ``` 5. Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the content below. This will build and deploy your site whenever you make changes to your content: .gitlab-ci.yml ```yaml pages: # The Docker image that will be used to build your app image: node:lts before_script: - npm ci script: # Specify the steps involved to build your app here - npm run build artifacts: paths: # The folder that contains the built files to be published. # This must be called "public". - public only: # Trigger a new build and deploy only when there is a push to the # branch(es) below - main ``` 6. Commit your changes and push them to GitLab. 7. On GitLab, go to your repository’s **Deploy** menu and select **Pages**. Here you will see the full URL of your GitLab Pages website. To make sure you are using the URL format `https://username.gitlab.io/my-repo`, uncheck the **Use unique domain** setting on this page. Your site should now be published! When you push changes to your Astro project’s repository, the GitLab CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy them for you.

# Deploy your Astro Site to Google Cloud

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using Google Cloud.

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is a full-featured web app hosting platform that can be used to deploy an Astro site. ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) ### Cloud Storage (static only) [Section titled “Cloud Storage (static only)”](#cloud-storage-static-only) 1. [Create a new GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate), or select one you already have. 2. Create a new bucket under [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage). 3. Give it a name and the other required settings. 4. Upload your `dist` folder into it or upload using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build). 5. Enable public access by adding a new permission to `allUsers` called `Storage Object Viewer`. 6. Edit the website configuration and add `ìndex.html` as the entrypoint and `404.html` as the error page. ### Cloud Run (SSR and static) [Section titled “Cloud Run (SSR and static)”](#cloud-run-ssr-and-static) Cloud Run is a serverless platform that allows you to run a container without having to manage any infrastructure. It can be used to deploy both static and SSR sites. #### Prepare the Service [Section titled “Prepare the Service”](#prepare-the-service) 1. [Create a new GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate), or select one you already have. 2. Make sure the [Cloud Run API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/run.googleapis.com) is enabled. 3. Create a new service. #### Create Dockerfile & Build the Container [Section titled “Create Dockerfile & Build the Container”](#create-dockerfile--build-the-container) Before you can deploy your Astro site to Cloud Run, you need to create a Dockerfile that will be used to build the container. Find more information about [how to use Docker with Astro](/en/recipes/docker/#creating-a-dockerfile) in our recipe section. Once the Dockerfile is created, build it into an image and push it to Google Cloud. There are a few ways to accomplish this: **Build locally using Docker**: Use the `docker build` command to build the image, `docker tag` to give it a tag, then `docker push` to push it to a registry. In the case of Google Cloud, [`Artifact Registry`](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling) is the easiest option, but you can also use [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). ```bash # build your container docker build . docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE HOSTNAME/PROJECT-ID/TARGET-IMAGE:TAG # Push your image to a registry docker push HOSTNAME/PROJECT-ID/IMAGE:TAG ``` Change the following values in the commands above to match your project: * `SOURCE_IMAGE`: the local image name or image ID. * `HOSTNAME`: the registry host (`gcr.io`, `eu.gcr.io`, `asia.gcr.io`, `us.gcr.io`, `docker.io`). * `PROJECT`: your Google Cloud project ID. * `TARGET-IMAGE`: the name for the image when it’s stored in the registry. * `TAG` is the version associated with the image. [Read more in the Google Cloud docs.](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling) **Using another tool**: You can use a CI/CD tool that supports Docker, like [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-to-gcr-github-action). **Build using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build)**: Instead of building the Dockerfile locally, you can instruct Google Cloud to build the image remotely. See the [Google Cloud Build documentation here](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-push-docker-image). #### Deploying the container [Section titled “Deploying the container”](#deploying-the-container) Deployment can be handled manually in your terminal [using `gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#service) or automatically using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build) or any other CI/CD system.

# Deploy your Astro Site to Microsoft Azure

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using Microsoft Azure.

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is a cloud platform from Microsoft. You can deploy your Astro site with Microsoft Azure’s [Static Web Apps](https://aka.ms/staticwebapps) service. This guide takes you through deploying your Astro site stored in GitHub using Visual Studio Code. Please see Microsoft guides for using an [Azure Pipelines Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-static-web-app-v0?view=azure-pipelines) for other setups. ## Prerequisites [Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites) To follow this guide, you will need: * An Azure account and a subscription key. You can create a [free Azure account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). * Your app code pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/). * The [SWA Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) 1. Open your project in VS Code. 2. Open the Static Web Apps extension, sign in to Azure, and click the **+** button to create a new Static Web App. You will be prompted to designate which subscription key to use. 3. Follow the wizard started by the extension to give your app a name, choose a framework preset, and designate the app root (usually `/`) and built file location (use `/dist`). Astro is not listed in the built-in templates in Azure so you will need to select `custom`. The wizard will run and will create a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) in the `.github` folder of your repo. (This folder will be automatically created if it does not already exist.) The GitHub Action will deploy your app (you can see its progress in your repo’s Actions tab on GitHub). When successfully completed, you can view your app at the address shown in the SWA Extension’s progress window by clicking the **Browse Website** button (this will appear after the GitHub Action has run). ## Known Issues [Section titled “Known Issues”](#known-issues) The GitHub action yaml that is created for you assumes the use of node 14. This means the Astro build fails. To resolve this update your projects package.json file with this snippet. ```plaintext "engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }, ``` ## Official Resources [Section titled “Official Resources”](#official-resources) * [Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/) ## Community Resources [Section titled “Community Resources”](#community-resources) * [Deploying an Astro Website to Azure Static Web Apps](https://www.blueboxes.co.uk/deploying-an-astro-website-to-azure-static-web-apps) * [Deploying a Static Astro Site to Azure Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions](https://agramont.net/blog/create-static-site-astro-azure-ssg/#automate-deployment-with-github-actions) * [Astro site deployment to Azure Static Web Apps with the CLI from GitHub Actions](https://www.eliostruyf.com/deploy-astro-azure-static-web-apps-github-cli/)

This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step. ```bash npx astro add netlify ``` See the [Netlify adapter guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/) to install manually instead, or for more configuration options, such as deploying your project’s Astro middleware using Netlify’s Edge Functions. ## How to deploy [Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy) You can deploy to Netlify through the website UI or using Netlify’s CLI (command line interface). The process is the same for both static and on-demand rendered Astro sites. ### Website UI deployment [Section titled “Website UI deployment”](#website-ui-deployment) If your project is stored in GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps, you can use the Netlify website UI to deploy your Astro site. 1. Click `Add a new site` in your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/) 2. Choose `Import an existing project` When you import your Astro repository from your Git provider, Netlify should automatically detect and pre-fill the correct configuration settings for you. 3. Make sure that the following settings are entered, then press the `Deploy` button: * **Build Command:** `astro build` or `npm run build` * **Publish directory:** `dist` After deploying, you will be redirected to the site overview page. There, you can edit the details of your site. Any future changes to your source repository will trigger preview and production deploys based on your deployment configuration. #### `netlify.toml` file [Section titled “netlify.toml file”](#netlifytoml-file) You can optionally create a new `netlify.toml` file at the top level of your project repository to configure your build command and publish directory, as well as other project settings including environment variables and redirects. Netlify will read this file and automatically configure your deployment. To configure the default settings, create a `netlify.toml` file with the following contents: ```toml [build] command = "npm run build" publish = "dist" ``` More info at [“Deploying an existing Astro Git repository”](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-deploy-astro/#deploy-an-existing-git-repository-to-netlify) on Netlify’s blog ### CLI deployment [Section titled “CLI deployment”](#cli-deployment) You can also create a new site on Netlify and link up your Git repository by installing and using the [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/). 1. Install Netlify’s CLI globally ```bash npm install --global netlify-cli ``` 2. Run `netlify login` and follow the instructions to log in and authorize Netlify 3. Run `netlify init` and follow the instructions 4. Confirm your build command (`astro build`) The CLI will automatically detect the build settings (`astro build`) and deploy directory (`dist`), and will offer to automatically generate [a `netlify.toml` file](#netlifytoml-file) with those settings. 5. Build and deploy by pushing to Git The CLI will add a deploy key to the repository, which means your site will be automatically rebuilt on Netlify every time you `git push`. More details from Netlify on [Deploy an Astro site using the Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-deploy-astro/#link-your-astro-project-and-deploy-using-the-netlify-cli) ### Set a Node.js version [Section titled “Set a Node.js version”](#set-a-nodejs-version) If you are using a legacy [build image](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#build-image-selection) (Xenial) on Netlify, make sure that your Node.js version is set. Astro requires `v18.20.8` or `v20.3.0` or higher. You can [specify your Node.js version in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) using: * a [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) file in your base directory. * a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable in your site’s settings using the Netlify project dashboard. ## Using Netlify Functions [Section titled “Using Netlify Functions”](#using-netlify-functions) No special configuration is required to use Netlify Functions with Astro.
